Wah Come over leg I have no one I can trust Arnd the center Later go my room  Ayy Now left project sigh my group hasn\\'t started on the report also dk what to write T_T do you think we have to look at adjusted r2?  fresh new data Yeah At least now got bukit timah From across 8 datasets combined Ya different months  can u send me the google maps thingy where u input the town name and they show the lat long Haha ok Just wanted to know the source Finally doneee btw u wanna see the shopee test wait how u know im coming tmr oh ian is so weird he says he cannot study with other ppl but he is going to biz tmr to study lol sian I just realized it would have been cool to include time-based data like when is the cheapest time to book airbnb in the week or which month  how do you interpret this btw? is it like ang mo kio is more expensive than southern islands? because the coefficients seem to be always positive no matter what and for the room_type also it looks a bit weird that both entire home and private room is more expensive than shared rooms and private rooms and shared rooms are more exp than entire homes as well yeah ikr but I googled online it seems like when you do it this way the coefficients will always be +ve +ve for all categorical variables Do you have any categorical variables? got any negative or not eh you only used one baseline for each variable right should I just do that? it\\'ll cut down the output by a lot maybe we can be same group next time :)  what do u think? Ya Copy paste probably assign to some TA Link plsss How u practice for dao2703?  Uh oh  is it like that? btw can help me print my acc2707 cheatsheet also?   2nd one haha Sent at 4.09 what do you think? will you do finba or bafin? Omg Then is it the table option? What was d Wah I swear im getting tricked by everything :( Think too much alr Hopefully can still get A Guess i didnt see properly >_> You think 35+/40 still can get A? But everyone will get Unless he gives me extra for finding out abt it  what does this mean is it one of the options is wrong but if average of the sample mean = pop mean it is an unbiased estimator or is it expected value != average can owo i dun want think abt it anymore No more A for me le Probably A- 27/40 Haha if i below median wont be texting u alr No chance for A le I guess sighs idk fk it A- so it is I thought I was confident but not overconfident I probably only made 2 careless mistakes I knew the rest of the questions or so I thought la probably wont matter in the long run la once 3k mods mostly projects liao and I\\'m happy with just getting B+/A- consistently every sem just that i thought this time I could get 3 As in one sem while I still can yeah I just pray I can get A for my other 2 mods dao2702 90% chance A- 5% A, 5% B+ just hope I dun get B+ lor I should get B+/A- for corporate accounting tax I just hope B+ still tmr to study I won\\'t get distracted I think in the end I will definitely be safe for 2nd upper after dropping tax I mean acc yeah im 4.42 now I thought can push to 4.5 this sem haha I think I\\'ll likely maintain ba around 4.4 cuz too high haha I know my cap is low for my capability I was 4 for the first sem then now all I can do is slowly push up after dropping acc I SU-ed a lot la :P my sem 2 CAP is 4.75 after SU then special term A I need like AAA-A-B+ basically my upper limit liao now that no SUs but y3s1 I think can do well also, since I\\'ll be taking 1k mods if you are motivated enough I feel a bit lost when I go through academic material yeah and it\\'s difficult as well No la Cuz u exchange what The roles only for those staying and me cuz im super onz That one cannot help Cuz need to be in singapore Next y3s1 I put u in I think A- for DAO alr sian The project wouldnt make a diff 10/10 But avg is 9 Damn stupid sia waste so much effort But 10 marks convert to 15% lol my finals grades disappeared isit cuz I never verify :/ haha we can become TAs in y3s1 although I\\'ll probably stay as jussi\\'s TA can la just ask liu qizhang he\\'s taking over eli maybe too much negative feedback Alex (BACT):\\nHi Alexander,\\n \\nI was thinking the new year will be best.\\n \\nOn another note, given your team has been conducting workshops already, I wanted to nominate some of you for the complimentary Tableau Desktop Specialist Exam. How many of you are “Tableau Experts” in the club that would be ready for a Certification exam?\\n \\nBest,\\nKJ Want or not Oh sad I also not ready after looking at the qns Yeah It is MCQ should I map global economy if I get the chance to? if the prof doesn\\'t allow me to map my 3rd BA module I can try to change it... ok hopefully can map the BA mod tho dba3702 ut3010 and mkt3811 it3010* what internship are you applying for? Anything haha What are the options I alr accepted so tingwei kicked me out 😢 wah so late changi carigos data analytics I working from 2nd may to 11 aug :( why so long? I thought you started around same time as me wah so long mine is jan to apr my exams end late so can\\'t travel last exam of the sem is 24th apr, and mine is 23rd apr my 2nd last exam is 16th apr 6 3 confirmed by the sch and 2 confirmed by profs the last one should be mappable, depending on the prof I think can map because I also my mySQL here but they also learn mongoDB in NUS 3 maybe can only map 2 but this is quite lame after taking the SQL I realized whatever I learn here just scratches the surface whatever you learn online is not enough this one is better haha just say you know SQL then go learn I said I was learning interactive web-enabled dashboards, then I got accepted so im forced to push myself now definitely not the other time Nelson (from shopee) came I saw his SQL code yeah true it\\'s hard to digest it\\'s flipped classroom too so I have to read before the lesson cuz got quiz      Oh wow I learnt all these already Prob not Dun have neural nets and ensemble I think you can try Unless it is a small part i guess hmm  Im taking this mod now Actually pretty similar to 3803 also, except dun have ensemble and time series But another prof say I can map to his mod alr Mkt3811 Idk maybe can I\\'m mapping to this mod and the prof approved... but I don\\'t think I\\'m learning much marketing as compared to the moduleo outline my SQL modded mapped alr even though I\\'m not learning mongoDB I think it depends on whether it is a small part your mod looks like predictive analytics using R though, which is essentially the same yeah logit is logistic regression which is linear classification your week 1 = week 12-13 DAO2702 oh if the language is different then it could be hard what language is it? why not doing internship though wtf why oh ya that\\'s right is it python? should ask cuz I think most courses use R I realized maybe fin isn\\'t for me I should just spec BA and ops management either they are teaching it badly, or I really don\\'t like it also very hard to self-learn because investopedia is so hard to understand too much technical jargon, even more than learning data analytics and a lot of times things don\\'t add up or make sense to me ya maybe it\\'s just the prof here :( global economy lectures skippable? fk I think I will die haha 2.5 days intern We are very happy to extend an internship offer to you, as Regional Operations (Customer Service) Intern with the following arrangement:\\n\\nPart-time from 12 August 2019 to 20 December 2019\\n\\nWe pay our interns at a monthly salary rate of S$1200/-.

I\\'m kinda done with qn 1 alr but a few parts I just write anyhow Idk quite lame la She follow prof advice This week session I just gonna leave it till last min Need to do hackathon AWS one   no :( i get free 9.9 shirt will get 10.10 and 11.11 too haha airbnb? this is so weird  Basics only About 3 months Cuz i nvr learn everyday Should have joined the aws hackathon It was at nus engineering And got buffet spread And they give free $75 credits If you\\'re not careful can incur huge costs No lol Still got free tier la But need to monitor usage Can omg jun kai I cant do this yea are you staying in sch until late? I finish work at 7 :/ I can bring my laptop to work then compare ans I gues which parts are these oh ok you got the same result as me I was worried that the MAPE for holt\\'s is 151% it is due end of 10 sep right? not before class I did this also data.train <- window(data_ts, end = c(2018, 7))\\ndata.test <- window(data_ts, start = c(2018, 8)) the time series I used doesn\\'t include the other features which makes me quite worried I\\'ve never done much timeseries at all but later when he teach kmeans I should be able to do in python I don\\'t know what he means exactly by moving average, but using the first half to train the second half cuz what you did was to take the first half and predict the 2nd half but moving average 3 mths should be like that: so I just called the entire dataset, and used rollmean function  anyway gonna sleep le tmr continue but he said Note that, when forecasting for month t+1, the history data from 2015-01 to month t are\\navailable.) should be predict for next month leh haha you go see bah, but i think this assignment hard to get full  marks yep  should be, but im not 100% sure also I think we all just followed the code he gave us he didn\\'t teach all these during the R lecture right R documentation / stackoverflow is so shit but I dont know how to do this in python so no choice yea I like python much more now R hard to debug you went to which uni for summer ah idk if I should go for winter 2 mc and 4 mc econs Oh shag Nvm then Heyyyy 4c I\\'m not sure, I need to check the slides again to understand what they mean Are you in sch btw nelson.lim i rmb this template LOL ok Sigh I fail the quiz alr No the kmeans also 5 mark I dunno if bcos grid or what So i used the grid :((( I did really badly lol  lets compare again  oh ya oops all the stations hor just using the boston map for 1(b) idk if need to explain so detailed but I think your statement is wrong \"I will calculate the probability of the student joining the society by taking the number of closest neighbours in the society divide by the total neighbours in the society.\" it\\'s not so simple look at my answer haha ya for e maybe need to talk about \"as well as the number of bike stations served by each depot.\" for f what do you think of my answer I didn\\'t mention manhattan distance but i guess i will now it\\'s due tmr 2359 right? you spent too much time on the code but I think need to secure the qualitative answers also idk i quite kiasu cuz my quiz probably wont do as well anyway I realized this sem finals quite chill it\\'s like 2 finals only and for 1k mods yea i will take some off from work around weeks 10-11 yea so unfair wah actually I like he long a lot I wish eli was half as good lol like he is so receptive to feedback ya I need the class part to make up for my mediocre quiz score omg.... there is 4 HW ya are you still going for BACT lol it\\'s getting more boring right would you like to be a content curator for my new project? I want to create sth like this no worries it\\'s a long term kind of thing topics will include AWS, react, nodejs, pandas, scikit-learn, keras, etc ya can non exhaustive then have a login page for users it\\'ll be a web app hosted on AWS with authentication, database, server similar to this I like web technologies more than data analytics tbh haha it\\'s supposed to be a learning platform so it\\'s good to have more stuff I\\'m very inspired by this guy thats not true excel kinda sucks tbh oh like for analytics ah idk leh I think it\\'s too simple a product last time when I was learning python I always thought I can do it faster in excel now i rather use python and python works with servers so it\\'s collaborative and now my job involves python and google spreadsheets google spreadsheets is just to display the data, but all the automation is done using python, APIs and spark eventually I want to be able to create and deploy my own analytics pipeline, instead of just knowing how to use pandas to clean data etc thats why I need all the building blocks I played around with AWS a lot, and one of the reasons why learning is so hard is because people dont document. It\\'s usually businesses that use AWS extensively. but I have friends who can help me, so I want to create documentation that everyone can use I cannot even do a single one lol this is very software engineering I guess this is my best creation so far It1001 I used html and css no framework or template involved This is one of my assignments They told us to host it there It is open source You can find it online Oh ok I dont have one What project is this? Oh ya for R Cool Very cool Using bootstrap I actually slept 13 hours And before 12 Is this for shiny R also? Do you need to learn html and css? Usually html is ez It is the css Like when to use flex display Wow is it template alr Like the side navbar Did you make it from scratch or r shiny gives you that Nice nice Means you got most of web dev alt Alr* Haha I can help you next time lolol ok not $13.30 right done ok thx once im done pls send me your hw also then can compare I\\'ll do first oh thx lol I should do first to maximise my learning :) logistic regression. Highest of out sample accuracy, simplest model by the principle of parsimony it\\'s only 2 marks I would choose the memory as it has the highest coefficient, and hence the highest positive correlation with the probability of the model being a good seller.\\n\\nIn terms of hardware scalability, the only attributes that can easily be increased are memory and hard drive space. Other factors such as weight, price and laptop size are likely confounding attributes (a higher processor speed might mean a heavier CPU, for example). HP cannot change their brand so we cannot change that.\\n\\nWhen we compare memory and hard drive, the coefficient for 1 TB of hard drive is 0.01, while it is 0.08 for 1 GB of memory. Thus, memory will have a greater impact and should be improved. I talked about what variables can be controlled then used the cofficients to explain why memory was selected jun kai you shouldn\\'t use zip code as a variable no leh i think it is ID I tried without then you cant use it as a numerical variable because it makes no sense a higher number doesn\\'t really mean anything yes but the number doesn\\'t mean anything leh unless it corresponds or sth like the latitude even if it means sth like 9999 means rich area and 0000 means poor area, we cannot be sure it\\'s evenly scald scaled* I also added this Logistic regression may have worked the best because the relationship between demand and the predictor variables are linear. For non-linear relationships, classification trees would work better. for last part ok can also but i think imputing 0 and then using median makes more sense I used groupby lol  Btw are you doing FSP soon? Have you found anything yet? I have been not invited to a group So depending on what alex and tingwei says I will have to find ppl Prof jussi told me he will have sth for me nuuuuuu 😢😢😢😢 😭😭😭😭😭😭  T______T maybe i do with ian and alex i have no other friends yes im quite an asshole so i cant work with random ppl I will need to have a word with alex about our promise with prof jussi haha we (kinda) promised our prof that we\\'ll do his project it\\'s almost like reserved for us I saw you added datacamp credentials to linkedin lol did you pay for it? haha I used it in year 1 summer then got it free for 1 year but I hardly used it at all ._. now no more alr sigh fml I guess I could rely on free resources too datacamp is just easier and can put on linkedin I didn\\'t finish cuz it was boring af but I realized I didn\\'t learn pandas properly and also didn\\'t finish my keras course yeah I rather not have videos cuz most resources is documenetation need to learn how to read and practice rather than watch videos even 2x speed it is too slow cuz got so many courses but now I got monitor so can multitask december hols :) I only got 1 project to do Nope it is RC4 CSC IT committee Frontend development ya this one I applied cuz I feel i got a lot of free time after this sem so if i dont join stuff i will be lazy but on 2nd thought I want to do stuff myself also like this guy my sec sch friend and JC classmate working at FB go read his education, experience and jarvis sigh I feel like only so much I can study at least not as content-intensive as other mods ya I just started around 1pm and took my time also case comp so late? sian if I dont stay in sch im also fked alr maybe stay PGP in yr 4 btw can help me print lol the RC4 printer ink died can their losses increasing though... on what basis though Done I thinking of buying tho Oh cannot ah I didnt know im ded quiz2  got python practical exam next sat project is 30% can pull up one depends on the variance for project how u know :O shit wtfff i think so far im only average so B+ cuz my quiz1 I got 15/30 below 25th percentile isn\\'t blue your score yea i guess it\\'s A- so competitive wtf this is a B- yep but nvm ah project can pull up one maybe next lesson just class part a bit more median only not enough to pull up my quiz 1 Done quite fun hehe  my CS1010E assignment is playing a game creating a game*  it\\'s individual assignment but they teach from scratch la should take haha but how come u cant take cuz of NOC? but overall leh I have +8 MCs from internship, +12 from acc mods, +4 from RC mods and still have enough for 1 spec and 1 minor leh unless you took a lot of UEs alr? oh ya cuz you\\'re poly right should just take even if you need to overload dao2702 nvr teach programming properly actually i can just let you watch the videos but i think need to watch this sem cant >_> but go watch this haha nope wow i can teach python  Just buy lol this is cheap I think our hw is significantly better la  My quiz 2 not even good Not as strong as your quiz 1 yep thats right not bad leh still got shopee voucher Haha 12.12 bah Play after exams going tmr finished work alr yea prioritise stuff due this week  haha im trying to pick stocks to earn some short term capital gain I missed a good opportunity to buy eagle hospitality at 0.43 now it\\'s 0.535.... the IPO is 0.78 so im not sure if it\\'s a good decision to buy it at the current price the negative sentiment seems to have been reversed people are realizing that their dividend yield at 0.43 is 13% and even if the DPU decreases it\\'s still a solid counter yeah risk is high but the price makes it worth I considered for some time alr and I didn\\'t buy cuz I thought I didn\\'t fully understand the risks oh well if it drops below 0.5 I might buy this stock is quite shady cuz of their sponsors singapore reit I think they\\'re stable enough to keep even if their price drops as they pay a regular dividend Do you have more qns??? Yes Yea those are different platforms How many 3ds games you have Can trade in i think We play tgt la Can raid boss pokemon Wow I thought you missed the sale? Bought pokemon yet? You can start playing before me Yep Or laptop charger But you risk bricking it Which one did you get? Neon redblue? wtf u playing now???

I need 6 iv ditto etc decided to go competitive this season Do you want to do resume critique with kenneth lam this fri? He specialise in tech and startups and fintech also since it\\'s your interest after finals still got lots to do sigh alex doesn\\'t want because his gf is currently paying for his nintendo switch online and if we join in then alex might have to pay for himself (although it\\'s really low with 4 ppl) 1 more day!!!!  wtf so fast do you even know what is pokerus? ok help me get a 6 IV ditto also need to start breeding soon alr can split one cuz the max raid is min 4 IV but can do 4 ppl so if you get a 6 IV, you should not save the game then invite 3 more ppl, who will join the raid then they will keep their dittos, but as the host you can reset again keep recycling infinitely just that I don\\'t know who has a 6 IV ditto yet .... ya battle and catch first so you need to collect tons of wishing pieces there\\'s the exploit now very fast one with all the exp candies just keep raiding faster than levelling do you soft reset for this? I only did it for zacian cuz I didn\\'t know you get eternatus first lol I guess I can use nature mints... no you have to put it in your party and fight battles then it\\'ll spread to your party slowly you should put 1 copy in the box so that it wont be cured and can pass on oh lmao just use a random rock mon HAHA fking magikarp pikachu clefairy even the snorlax fking useless giga impact then break one bar only best is actually solrock cuz he boost def and doesn\\'t die fast so less burden anyway you can just use random pokemon you catch cuz level doesn\\'t matter in raids 5 Havent really played those games projected grades this sem:\\nIT1001: A\\nDBA3803: A- (maybe A)\\nCS1010E: A-\\nUTW2001H: B+ (maybe A-) are you free tmr afternoon? ok want to do resume? yeah can, it\\'s a UE I think free A also cuz it is easy and not bellcurved class size was 8 for me for the mod it\\'s just a bit of everything BA, database networking hardware I doing resume now ohhh same he\\'s quite good same  after today\\'s paper idk if i can get A- for CS 1k mod haha\\\\ prob A- bah is like im competing with y1 engin students and i got prior experience but still not guaranteed A- feels bad actually i did well bah i probably expected better but CS1010 is hard there are just yr 1 engin ppl who are extremely good playing league now haha not many ppl in RC ended finals yeah what time do you want? I think afternoon = 12 noon to 3pm for kenneth like 20min bah errr go back I guess I should go home also dont u stay quite near or raid battles? :D i need to get my resume done well to apply for internships i don\\'t have time next week cuz im interning full time alr and he doesn\\'t meet ppl on weekends full time for 2 weeks gotta make it count what time will you be coming tho tmr ok best ditto? mine is 31/31/30/31/25-29/31 still considered 4 IV I guess.... but the offensive stats are perfect so I\\'m settling for that what? you need a 6 IV ditto 1 31/31/31/31/31/31 and 1 31/31/31/31/31/0 for special attackers you need 31/0/31/31/31/31 to minimize confusion damage and 1 31/0/31/31/31/0 for TR too so ideally you have 4 dittos for IVs and modest, adamant, timid, jolly, quiet, brave, calm, bold these are the main natures maybe relaxed or sassy also wtfffff this is quite good leh why didn\\'t you reset for me :( if you have that kind of IVs can just keep cloning ya if you ever get 6 IV just restart it\\'ll still be there then invite me I will catch it then you reset again infinite 6 IV dittos sell on carousell I told you about my pokemon travels in 2017 right before uni started I got paid trips to melbourne, sao paulo, indianopolis, los angeles and london but I didn\\'t go london cuz it clashed with marketing presentation in week 13 just to play pokemon lol that year I was quite hardcore TPCi the pokemon company international next year will be my comeback earn points in VGC I was top 4 in asia haha sao paulo is over alr but we can still go melbourne and berlin huh why?? wah sick leh they sponsor ah? my friend told me now china included in the VGC circuit and they\\'re just paying to fly to tournaments to hoard points so I guess I won\\'t be able to really compete with them back then most of the tournaments were held in SG so singaporeans had an advantage now to really be competitive you need a lot of time, money and skill back then only need skill and time cuz if you win local tournaments, you get travel awards to go overseas need to win local + travel overseas and win those too cuz it\\'s relative lol MY also got tournaments and cheap to travel there actually I think if you win all the tournaments SG should be enough like 1st place if consistently top 8 then MY + SG and once you get top 8 in internationals it\\'s a lot of points alr 😭😭😭😭😭 reaching soon? in RC lol lets meet at biz i guess same ok i shall leave now Psps Haha   and also I think if I continue doing what I enjoy and not what other ppl think is impt I will still do well if I enjoy software development im sure i will have fun learning and doing projects even if im not as good as cs students i will probably still do ok mine is g703 I think it\\'s the same tbh I researched a bit g603 is purely wireless while g703 has the wired g703 wireless is the same as g603  they released answers so fast lol yea i did ok i guess as i expected but not sure if B+ or A-  thx what ball u want for sirfetched must be purchaseable ok premier ball? white goes with white  sigh they\\'re japanese  HAHA all the nuswhispers oh ya i rmb this lecture he was searching for memes when the other prof was trying to teach LOL the culture changed    coding guidebook the first few chapters are quite interesting I feel I should watch kimetsu no yaiba also sigh so much to do even after finals.... but I hope the 2 weeks after my internship ends will be enough time to do everything before next sem developer stuff breed mons lose weight upgrade my PC I feel like I\\'ll just procrastinate man...  3.8k I feel like if you want good pay need to get ppl to know you This is a recruitment post so it is probably for a non tech company Sounds too generic Yeah dont do ops Ops pay damn low Need to do into real data science and engineering jobs Research and high level wokr Ok I will start next year I just bought insurance $47 a month healthcare and accident still thinking if i should get the CI one critical illness yea how much are you paying monthly? this one is only accident i think i used to get the $25 one for 200k accident + life haiz idk if I just got sold by a really good salesperson yeah I think he\\'s damn good though wah but what is covered? both in his career and as a salesman hospitalisation also ah? really?? :O yeah i read about it it doesn\\'t cover hospitalisation only critical illness, death and accidents no ah it\\'s like if you stay hospital it\\'ll be fully covered currently we\\'re all under medishield life which is fully paid through CPF medisave* but medishield life only covers up to a certain amount im reading seedly and moneysmart now yeah i guess so think i dont mind paying like $90 a year to get insured up to B1 but my friend rly oversold with the riders lucky got free-look policy I\\'ll probably ask him about it and downgrade/cancel yeah it\\'s not yea it is you\\'re right do you think it is better to buy critical illness now though? to lock in the rate but it\\'s really expensive ahh ok cuz the critical illness one is for life so just need to pay for 20 yrs then covered for life but the premiums are pretty ex 112 a month but the rates will only go up so I did the math if I buy later and invest my money now it won\\'t cover the difference if i buy later hmmm how so? I calculated my returns if i invested the amount of money i spend on CI for 2 years assuming I wait till im 25 and I need to get about 8% annualised returns if I wait till 43 the gap is even bigger because the rate increases linearly and I will be less insured from 23 to whatever age when I buy the insurance yes so doing some cost benefit analysis assuming that I will need that much insurance in the first place i guess but im sure i will cuz if you buy insurance when you\\'re 65 it\\'s gonna cost a lot, if you just rely on term insurance until then death table? ahh ok I guess I expect to live until 70+ I just look at life expectancy i guess not too concerned about the probabilities here hmmm yeah it\\'s also under the assumption that I will live past the period of time when im paying but would you get a critical illness policy though? actually CPF is a different construct altogether because it is a social policy hmm ok I guess I really just wanted to buy for 20 yrs and forget about it but I think I should also consider whether I want it in the first place and there may be better products elsewhere ahh true I think this plan is not the cheapest also sian I wish my friend didn\\'t approach me in the first place I know I will make a logical decision for sure definitely gonna cancel my hospitalisation rider now it\\'s too expensive I think basic hospitalisation and accident is still ok cuz the accident one covers a bit more stuff like dengue I dont haha heart attack, stroke, cancer and 12 more i cant rmb yeah but those would include the different types of cancer whereas AIA just considers it as 1 yea me too i havent bought the CI one yet but thats why i should talk to more non insurance ppl they rly earn a lot sia this guy takes 5 mods but earns like 4k a month but at least he tells me but the only way to get it without commission is to become one yourself sighhh you worked in insurance also ah yea im avoiding ILP they get 40% of your first year and 20% thereafter i think wew I can admit that money also tempts me but selling is not what im good at I will probably be forever at the roadside begging for customers lol wow thats MLM man btw my aunt joined MLM she tried to sell my dad some health products claimed that when dissolved in water the lightbulb lit up so it contains real ions wtf it\\'s understandable i have 2 biz friends who work more than study now I think they dont even need the biz degree to work in insurance   not sure how this works.... jun kai you have to help me im extremely naive and guillible Yeah thats the worst My friend signed up for 25 yrs Like fixed deposit but get low returns And bear higher risk Oh well i will sleep on it and probably downgrade Wow thanks That is quite a comprehensive list of qns thanks jun kai will treat you to 2 RC meals if you come this week I can tap 3 times a day until fri haha but their monthly salary quite good leh think we shouldn\\'t worry too much about money now haha just go with what you like and the money will eventually come yeah I probably wouldn\\'t work at shopee too shag alr fml maybe I\\'m quite bad at coding after all those are not actual skills :( unless you sell insurance ya should have done that oh well i need to find sth i enjoy doing also not sure if i like coding all day I guess I liked learning how to code but applying and troubleshooting myself is painful.... maybe need to learn properly then it will get more fun actually I feel like the ppl who dont code have it easy just discuss all day make ppt look at spreadsheets I probably like that kind of social interaction also  the startup that I interned in was quite nice the culture is like RC very laid back reason why im really not into data science haha Wah no leh you unlock gigantasnorlax alr? it\\'s available now for free mystery gift  I\\'ll check when i get back haha useful stuff for coding I really think you should try software development very different from data analytics kind of code thats true but can apply management to product and engineering the pay also quite good the engineers at shopee get paid 5k+ starting equal to sea MAP and I think it\\'s very skills based cannot really fake your way through can try ah if you\\'re free $15 SGD now for a 100+ hr course I really liked this i spent all my time doing this over exchange AWS also impt have to learn can give yourself 5 yrs to learn bah the CTO in my previous internship earns like 20k sia and he\\'s like 40+ only startup leh lol is like middle level manager yeah cuz under him is all the developers 20 ppl only in the company and most of them in sales ops haha if you have startup with just 2 ppl still called CEO what but he\\'s the reason why i wanted to switch in the first place this kind of job is very nurturing but if im good enough :( do you want to climb corporate ladder? i think i cant cuz im bad with people I need to base it on skills really? I think you and ian are too nice idk i feel like corporations cant be too nice or rather, not ambitious like you wont take advantage of others for yourself actually ppl in biz very money-minded including me alex and ian also but most of my high flier RC4 friends never rly think about money Yea this one is easier I think can just jump into solutions architect associate Since it doesn\\'t stack Like if you can get SA is better You dont need cloud prac to do SA Yea The NTUC skillsfuture sth Every 1st day of the month But I was also asking myself that qn You can sign up for AWS educate for free now They have tutorials and you can earn credentials Put on linkedin Without paying I think the MCQ qns there are pretty much trivia qns lol For educate I think the CCP is about the same It is really not technical Like how does cloud help organisations Or what are the applications of AWS lambda The differences between iaas and saas All covered in IT1001 also lol cuz jeff bezos is also an intern at his own company gives him the motivation to push further probably more haha but sea quite shag their work culture I heard visa MAP is 6k ok do with me :D I help you get project Actually it is probably SIA Just replicate DBA3803 final project Lel Idk yet havent asked Cuz im a burden for the SIA project Not involved at all I will ask next sem i guess also I think i decided to buy the health insurance with rider after all so that\\'s like 380 per year :( cuz if you get some illness the price will increase whereas if you get into an accident, the rate will stay the same so i guess it\\'s a bit of risk mitigation also I know of a friend who got cancer last year and the insurance really helped him luckily for him, cuz people our age dont have critical illness insurance oh ya they did hmmm what is it called again? I remember they dont cover health leh that one is critical illness, not hospitalisation leh the last one? that one is not hospitalisation yeah I will get aviva for accident and CI I guess or just for accident, since CI only covers till a certain age  Gmax meowth lol It is out Wild area How to pirate software? I need adobe XD is your favourite drink the first one? 1h 45min before the weekend!!!!!  I am just burnt out I need to move stuff back, apply for internships, upgrade resume, linkedin, breed pokemon, build a proper competitive team, cut hair, exercise, sleep so much to do also I think I\\'ll buy a new monitor or speakers during 12.12 to reward myself shall we work on sth together? hobby project I dont want to rot again rediscover my passion for learning oh ya this one ok I shall do AWS and datacamp too then I going holiday to japan also 10 days before sch starts woohooo wah nxt gen think I find an internship which is more project-based and less work-oriented like less routine tasks but just one big project which i have full ownership of not sure if amazon is like that cuz it sounds like saikang to me >_>  thinking of just getting 2 the optimal price is 2 then I\\'ll start breeding my team Go play fire emblem 3 houses I guess so.... after that IU concert do you still have datacamp? im also trying to brush up on my pandas data wrangling and ML especially for neural networks in keras I realized our DBA3803 project I totally forgot about classification report even though I built it from scratch in a way sigh haha do together i also have datacamp got 2 pandas data wrangling courses I just briefly covered never actually finished oh... shit I need to go learn R also yeah... need all those certification use this as a reference yes alex bought pokemon swsh how\\'s your holiday btw why you don\\'t want go japan :( i help you buy scorbunny ok then i get sobble yes scorbunny woohoo just chilling now until end of week learn how to write test cases for my project done alr >_< when are you back ah I forgot when we\\'re meeting im too embarrassed to ask looks like can buy sea idk if I should still buy at this price probably better opportunities elsewhere but im quite confident in shopee\\'s growth but maybe that\\'s already factored into the price this year my investments provided 75% capital gain and 25% dividend gain so maybe I should look to add some growth stocks also but it showed that REITs are still performing quite well, maybe because investors are looking for safe picks amidst an uncertain economic climate but next year im quite sure the economy will pick up shopee gave out 2 months bonus, and it\\'s also US elections nope but my boss got so getting dinner treat tmr I also want to be an apple farmer in japan no ah it\\'s just a joke title the video is pretty cool NUS in 30 min  see how lol you\\'re just taking 1 BA mod next sem? want to take DBA4811 if it\\'s available? seminars in analytics is also quite chill i think just listen to ppl talk I can do more IS mods first what\\'s quantum computing??? why is it fin? :O sounds like a computing mod lol quantum computing lets take CS2030 and 2040 also if not melvyn sim will you still take DBA3701? why not do the consulting one with me cuz they only offer one sem a year DBA3701 take another sem cuz thats always offered and it\\'s not a prereq for another mod also or replace IT3010 but that one quite impt cuz most internships use SQL  2 more days :) anyway I didn\\'t apply for any internships or update my resume too busy gaming and doing my projects also haven\\'t watched kimetsu no yaiba yet sigh go take IT1001 legit free A it is fine what sometimes we get A, sometimes we get A- remember I told you how scared i was when I thought I will get B+ Mystery Gift codes for free Poke Balls! \\n\\nCode 1: K0UN1NMASC0T\\n\\nCode 2: 1YAHAYA\\n\\nCode 3: 0KUGAFUKA1B0RU\\n\\nCode 4: PRESENT go to BBA office then just fill up a form and pay $10 yeah cannot quite lame my CAP is 4.43 now haha yea btw global economy cannot SU right wait so can SU? nope dont email prof go to BBA office but when my appeal got rejected I was quite angry then I sent email to qizhang and cc eli and wang tong bureaucracy lol cuz idk how I got B+ for DAO2702 then I asked lewin and I got at least same marks as him if not higher so I had a strong case lor then melvyn sim sent me letter saying DAO department apologise for the error  yeah, especially if you know exactly how much you got right you probably have a good case but if there\\'s a mistake, you cant just cc your prof cuz he he\\'s the one who checks yep thats the official method btw how do you know melvyn sim is good I think he\\'s teaching next sem cuz there\\'s only one slot not sure if im ready to take such a theorectical and heavy mod next sem yeah but in research and not teaching it\\'s usually mutually exclusive I know melvyn is a idgaf kind of prof very unlike he long is bad I think im gonna take sth else I need the skills in ERP ties in with my goals of doing stuff related to devOps and cloud computing definitely not IS3221 i realized it\\'s my IT1001 prof haha are you only taking DBA3701? Optimisation is not recommended I heard v hard everything is impt i guess importance depends on what you want to do I think im more interested in the data engineering side rather than theory and math yea just need FSP A first class is a burden LOL gives more unhappiness than happiness next time when we\\'re 40 we\\'ll wonder if all that stress is worthwhile btw tell me when you\\'re going BBA office i want to talk to helen chai and rowina catch up a bit if you got a B+ that you can SU you will SU right LOL you should go see NUSWhispers ya I have zelda lol abit I havent got the parachute why are you not playing pokemon :( btw what is your favourite type Maybe 11.45 Very fast one Just submit form Rmb to print Did your R mod get A?

I applied DBS, shopee and CAG singtel was weird... didn\\'t see any application for internships on their site so left with NUS IT and govtech wah nice how was their test? yeah ohh maybe they changed it LOL not pymetrics right  Eating now alr :( Btw I havent do my DBS assessment when is it? shag btw did you have to choose your roles? did AWS get back to you? Hope you get in 👍 Expand my connections there hehe  this guy is quite boring.... at least no class part I\\'ve been hearing this over and over again we just need more data centers dunnid DNA storage which is not reliable I learnt this during SEP if consulting is so easy why are consultants paid so much? why is he manually typing the bins???? isn\\'t this the ctrl shift enter no this is HR they don\\'t even need to use SQL shopee is about 4.5k for business roles or data roles developers get more i think I am hungry why is he using the full 3 hrs same what does your model predict? now is $41 leh should I buy or not ok my friend in shopee now I just need to ask him if got nuts in the pantry apparently it\\'s correlated with stock price I thought primary sch sia can\\'t set the date?? oh wait see wrong nvm I have to take if not I wasted my time doing all this yea man jeremy webcasting cuz wuhan also maybe his mod a lot of china ppl cuz masters of supply chain management practice exam 20 usd AWS rly know how to profit im an idiot Oh fk HAHA shit Sorry 😢 How is class  yes I just woke up actually I was working on ianbot last night quite intense ded got ppl reply me but I don\\'t understand what they saying so right I was trying to configure a postgres database for my app in heroku THEN SOMEONE TOLD ME I CAN JUST USE GOOGLE SHEETS and I was like shit... should have done that from the start cuz a lot of this database management (that is not mysql) is native to linux anyway sorry I didn\\'t actually intend to skip class I thought I could wake up next time I teach you how to make telegram bot ok once I finish this project WTF can someone just ask him what\\'s the difference between business intelligence and consulting? is a consultant just an overpaid and overrated business analyst no webcast ah \"On the email dated 27 Jan it is stated that teaching staffs are \"all required to make teaching materials available online\". It is compulsory, not up to the professors\\' discretion. If any prof is not doing it please report him/her.\" Matters a bit I guess :( This one is endgame Got rejected by EDB But they reject so fast  My insurance agent offering me internship He just got his MDRT sia Huge ceremony how much will it be? but will i enjoy the job im sure my friend enjoys his work I think he\\'s quite smart also know how to read ppl haha but I keep suanning insurance agents later distribute flyers cuz my friend is an insurance agent himself... I think it\\'s the latter see if shopee replies me T_T I want my fast-track MAP at sea does not fit into my mindset of a cool job tho if I can work from home and earn 4k idm that kind of life or if I really enjoy going to office earning only 4k is ok but im highly skilled thanks for the affirmation haha but maybe the job industry wont think that way altho i think if i go shopee will get 4k im sure startups have its own share of problems but govtech seems pretty cool bottom 10% but is ok ppl keep telling me about cross industry knowledge im pretty much a generalist in tech im not good at programming but i know much more about databases than a cs student of course not but eventually these things catch up to you u know I did some unethical shit and helped some groups for $$ prob wont do it again but cuz they knew me wait did i tell u before lol like who i helped ya tongxin lol idk I know another group got A- even though their midterms fail 2 2nd group paid me more 2.5x more haha price discrimination I think i can set up a tuition center if this python thing becomes popular get some work experience then start my tuition center when im about 30 if they got python projects in secondary sch in a few years time gg is it I tank this mod also? 1k yea HAHA WTF I think my friend wanted to offer me this $1200 internship FEE 😂😂😂 never heard of internship fee before no even if they offer me 1k im also hesitant prob will be done by today :D yeah it\\'s for biz ppl it\\'s quite cool you can do machine learning also connect with DBS vickers API do some stock analysis with python using telegram commands then buy or sell stocks in the same interface or schedule tasks yep as long as can do in python code it\\'s possible  bembot biz exchange module-mapping about 30 hours around 6 per day but you can do it in 12 I wasted too much time on postgres and docker cuz I thought it\\'ll be cool to learn but turns out that most of these tools are native to linux which means that it\\'s harder to use on windows many of the tools are really hacky in the end I just opted for google spreadsheets + API so much easier thats what I think of myself also but I really enjoy doing this I want to make a stock price predictor + DBS vickers I think really can make money haha yep a lot of guides I can send u template  tbh idk if I\\'m really ready for AWS looking at this right... it\\'s a bit too technical but im sure it\\'s required for be a solutions architect facing this problem now tho :( ok im done deploying!!! Biz Module Mapping Bot u can use it live nope heroku does it for us I think my app crashed again you need to learn how to use command line and git damn really got a lot of things to make can make a web scraper dont have to open your browser to view stock prices or download an external app for accenture ikr even more stressful than usual UOB? ahh bloomberg sounds good welp I still haven\\'t got contacted by any company haha idk if I should have applied accenture tbh I really thought it\\'s what I want to do yeah it is prob dont want to work on a shitty project also is there anything to do for the consulting mod?

Ok we come over wtf I slept the whole afternoon did you see much coffee I drank?  no libraries ah this one is kinda hard this one was my CS1010E PE2 the hardest qn cuz cannot use libraries but if you use itertools it\\'s easy or this hmm yep how about finding the optimal strategy for some game? does optimization take into account the probability of random events?     like farmville plant crops then got random events like drought ohh ok not like simulation ah restaurant city? wah but that one got randomness hard to get data also wah thanks we are meeting again right nope i trying lose my belly grabbed google knows MCA dividend also credited to MCA yep just split 5k into 1k per counter but buy around august la thats why I promise not to sell keeping for passive income I get about 100 per month end goal is 2k per month ya yea dividend yield only 20k actually I exclude autowealth cuz the dividends are reinvested how do you search for new ways to make money like the app you found or is it like coincidence I think your methods are quite fun maybe I encountered before but never find ways to exploit usually those apps that pay you $$ for ppl you recommend there was a crypto platform that pays you crypto that you can instantly cash out if you refer friends one person about $10 yeah yay you can have 2 of the same keys which is not allowed in a dictionary from my ex-boss should have taken data viz instead of optimization the syntax for filtering is correct but your key is wrong if you try df_wide[\\'Country_Region\\'] you\\'ll also get an error err you try type df_wide.columns see what u called your country maybe it\\'s country_region that\\'s because it\\'s grouped type df_wide.index actually they have a function to filter grouped dfs oh shit it seems like a different concept multi index not same as grouped df ok you have to filter by date and country_region unless you change how you index because it is indexed by date then country_region so to access the values you use df_wide.loc[\\'2020-01-23\\', \\'Australia\\'] ideally you switch the order so you can access australia for all the dates then it\\'s just df_wide.loc[\\'Australia\\'] thanks for sharing the data btw prob will help a lot is this your \\'for fun\\' project? or for optimization? yea this one can do forecasting lol thats the data problem i guess Ya Ok Can do covid yes ok yep whats your error yep so now you need to use clean_output to rearrange this have you got this part yet honestly not easy im still thinking yep kk im done try:\\n   <original line>\\nexcept BaseException:\\n   print(\"error statement here\") what does the code do now this one is readable this one is your fault oh ok data = None\\n\\ndata = <pull data here>\\n\\nif data:\\n    do whatever you were trying to do because when you assign something to x you\\'re pulling data from an external source you\\'re not sure if it will run properly then the if block only runs if you have data in the else block just try to terminate the script HAHA print(lessons) nope oh wait print(module) below lessons = [] haha probably the reason why ppl take weeks to code i will take a look later maybe the list outdated the one that you fetch from the api yep but you return data right oh yea hmm maybe that particular json is not embedded in a list is this particular one right nice haha so what was it yea wru now tho ok was planning to shower wait for you come first bah is it this part? nice getting the hang of it haha it looks like the same part it\\'s the [0] i think i mean it has to be lol yep empty list quite easy just indent in an if block ```if module[\\'semesterData\\'] not good practice to use len because if the object has no length property it might throw an error instead you know that an empty list evaluates to False if [1,2,3]:\\n    print(\"list is not empty\") if []:\\n    print(\"list is empty\")  # will never print want go eat udon don? im sick of dh food ok just the plastic bag right Reached quite easy what just write a function that cleans it up for idx, list_item in enumerate(list_of_lists):\\n    if list_item = list_of_lists[idx + 1]:\\n         list_of_lists.remove(list_item) then just think about how you\\'ll compare each element once should be O(n!) at most first item check with all the items in the list 2nd check with all except the first no it is 2^n I only know the n! solution for this LOL err I know I rmb alr but you need to use a recursive function ok nvm seems quite easy I don\\'t understand why you need to sort it though apparently you can sort sequeneces like lists also you can even sort words  small letters always bigger than big letters and z > y > x > ... > a I should continue working on this yay 90% of the work done do you still have your pdf thing can send me plsss my prof wants the work to be done by 3pm tmr wtf so demanding how to use ah whats the serial number wtf am I supposed to input a serial number is this in the zip? damn i turned off alr and they deleted the exe file lol nvm I just need to use for this project :/ haha nvm next time bah I just have to download all the pictures from my pdf how do i do this though   if you\\'re interested to volunteer for govtech projects to help out with covid like all the graphs they\\'re supposed to be images but actually .... wtf im also losted sighhh I realized that the tex file (used to compile the pdf) is 55 pages but the pdf is only 5 pages oops this one instead it has 56 pages total but I want to extract all the embedded jpeg/png images in the pdf instead of using snipping tool for everything :( have to manually use snipping tool ah ahh ok thanks Yes No Very different You need a name == main To run python files Another ide Personally I use pycharm for python and vscode for javascript Oh this sounds like shopee? The last line Basically I used pycharm at shopee It became my default Refer to my teat Test* I can help you also Cuz I test in jupyter then put into .py script Can but at that time I didnt know You need to know command line To run .py Yes Create associations too Ya means quite long Who reply you btw Is it grace or crystal Oh he is the head of interns He just graduated last year Joined as fulltime while I was interning No This one yes I think You cant Not the same as rstudio either You have to learn the debugger Lol what time is your test I can help you la If I wake up It should be similar to my one though Wah you have 2 tests ah I only had one previously 1 hour also right Lol you just send me the python one haha You need to go to settings Click python interpreter Click the dropdown The settings icon maybe yes thats why i hate it just run functions can ah like you can just port over to pycharm just copy + paste lol it will work yeah then just comment out your answers yep you can think of a structure at the top read data then middle write functions, 1 for each qn then just run functions 1 by 1 and slowly debug do you get this? Dont worry about it actually Just run in jupyter And comment the answers This one is impt Like just take the hard output and comment it It should run but maybe it is your python interpretor Anyway how do you run it In the terminal And also need to have the excel file in the same dir Indeed Oh no How come Wait this is an outlook issue i think Haha Pycharm is high barrier to entry A lot of features and not intuitive And fking slow Shopee will teach you more about pycharm I guess Same as philip right Got 1 hour la so can test out Make a small dataset and query Did you try to write a hello world script I know why alr You dont have pandas Python doesn\\'t come with pandas Anaconda does Hmm In pycharm you should be able to see your installed packages python 3.7? yea dont use conda for pycharm I also dont know why but I learnt from experience so how was it though the test Wtf Wow So much trust If I have to pay someone it means I prob wont get A alr And this sem is SU sem can just study a bit and just pass Thats what im doing for global economy no only projects cuz I don\\'t get any experience out of quizzes wtf thats insane hmm idk leh I\\'ll be quite tempted it\\'s less ethical for sure because I don\\'t do the entire projects I just do most of it they still write the report but I do the code I signed up alr haha 😔 go join are you on for the kiasufoodies clone I can make telegram bots now we can make a startup together and get a 10k grant as in something similar not in the same field like Outside we can do a telegram bot which allows people to apply for internships and graduate jobs and automate the interviewing and onboarding process replace all the HR people save costs telegram bots can accept documents as input and use text parsers to extract information yes but these people use web-based platforms their portals are ugly and not user friendly especially EY and singtel I think it\\'s quite viable leh especially given how manual HR is my friend did this he earns a commission from people who posts jobs getting around 1k per month but what if we extend this to profesisonal jobs? internships? we can take a bigger cut yes but this is not integrated with the current HR workflow I can make that happen automate emails push to database when he was in army he\\'s 1 year younger than me pretty crazy right self-taught programmer + his friend 2 people\\\\ dont do this fking hard to read very bad practice use descriptive short names  testing their bot I have buttons alr ok I spent the entire day coding I alternate why are you awake though it\\'s really cool though haha do you think you\\'ll enjoy making telegram bots? I think I enjoy stuff that I know will be useful for other ppl than something theoretical like optimisation or data science I enjoyed data viz though jeremy is good should have joined us instead of optimization or cs1010e im actually crazy awake now got the hackathon feeling im quite tired though >_> try this if you free someone sent me this so i didn\\'t have a choice yea   connecting to gsheets you need to create a service account in google cloud, then create a json containing credentials Are you creating new file I think the method is write Not upload Wait I use gspread Not df2gspread It is here This one is to connect This one is to write Yes It works the same way Just copy the snippet You can read the entire table right Like A1:E5 Need to know how big is your dataframe Then convert to the cell range Quite troublesome lol Use np.shape Okok im on mrt i come home first I sent you last timw In daily_report_final Ok Tmr im in office later I will be doing gsheets so I can send you code did this work for you though? what did you use? oh ok I should try that I just need to read df into python how you get credentials lol thanks! so i did it differently every time i do this i do it a different way LOL I tried to follow my own slides and i couldn\\'t wtf uh not today i joining my friend tmr? lol but i havent eat with my team for so long also cuz ytd they busy i go myself ok next week where tho wfh oh i got meeting at 2pm later anyway thurs quite busy >_< yay it\\'s working Vscode  should try colab haha easier to work with ppl and gsuite stuff Lol Ok  much better hehe google colab dunnid credentials.json or activate API besides LDA what is the other model you used ok thx gonna use for my FSP we analysing customer feedback why JC kids not poly 😡 LOL can request to PM I think PM got budget to allocate for labelling idk lol we also outsource labelling ya quite expensive also sia 1 million rows prob cost about 50k during the meetings got say before wtf thats a lot i can only do 50 im bad at repetitive tasks ya but better 1. the markdown shows you a preview on the right\\n2. shows you class methods for classes\\n3. can share with ppl send me scripts pls on how to connect to lumos oh how about the python script that your friend wrote 🙁 send me after work? 😧 haha some of my codebase also taken from what ppl wrote though I haven\\'t had the time to go and study and integrate into a style I can understand before I leave this week I also should archive like for using mouse? or for sports? im ambidextrous btw writing is damn hard lol I\\'m only ambi for eating my left hand also stronger than my right hand Ok now ah ok Wru I got someone to help us Cafe  haha can send me as file  thanks 😄  the notebook we were looking for haha did you get yay aren\\'t you working though nice haha yea I think I will attend first then decide whether I should apply can send me my photo :D when you want to find kenneth btw I need him vet my resume again before I apply zoom call yea BBA office wfh thanks!!! can send me your resume :D ok maybe later ian nvr send me sia >_< uh it\\'s possible if your resume isn\\'t that solid my resume also sucks now thats why I haven\\'t applied did they ask for testimonial/references also?

I think after we grad we won\\'t have all these chances alr and also good for networking interest group just to play and to meet ppl yea and maybe contract bridge what mods are you taking how about BT4222 I waited for you :( plssss  take with me and alex and yingjie big alex small alex got A- no la can get A- one learn tensorflow and NLP take MKT and BT tableau can self learn anyway next time cant use tableau also for work ppl use powerBI just put tableau it\\'s like drag and drop if you learn NLP it\\'s more applicable web mining will come in handy when you work at shopee okok I got B+ for BT4212 la even though it was hard yea honestly I can just give you my project then you can just replicate then it\\'s like the entire mod\\'s content Yay Big alex confirm taking So left yingjie yingjie is being convinced at this moment Count me in first haha I wanna be same group oh no...  how do you clear this cant find sia how to climb the peak? ooh I knew it weird leh I still cannot maybe is the quest lmao I never actually do  lmao I thought need to climb cliffs turned out to be shorter than I thought need bennett to light up flames and he is holding the event sword is it those 2 shards wow so fast sia ganyu is bowwww  better for me actually too many sword characters what puzzle is this ohh ok shit I never keep track oh ya whats your tree level now 6 7 more :( EWTF im still 3 short ok lvl 8 same 91% lvl 8 and cleared all the quests alr now just waiting for event  this random island got sth but no scarlet nope it\\'s mondstadt 1.3 should be bigger finally get to go japan around march I think will be bigger than mondstadt but smaller than liyue howw dun have lol HAHA but you also dont show us :/ let me send you a picture of icebear  I ditched oddish alr maybe when we meet I show you :) ok fine if you show me I will show you why you ignore me :( Okok Let me think about it How about this Why leh Wont fail one Cannot fail one Got all the group projects Alex did before also so got resources most likely get B+ or A- la very hard to get A for sure ok level 48 —> 49 is so slow yea I won\\'t hit AR50 anytime soon I started the week at AR48  im here now possibly 2 more weeks lol btw one of our friends got shopee BI it\\'s 4.5k samantha did she talk to you oh no so fast sia im still starting ahh it is I thought the last story will be longer ehh do you co-op? yea quite fast but I take a lot of dmg and cannot heal also maybe I should use jean instead of ZL max HP heal  yea jade parcel but I end up full hp cuz of jean yea it\\'s faster this item impt food pouch cuz cannot pause need to heal faster in case I mess up and forget to break the thing I still cant oneshot wow childe + diluc? ohh diluc is so good I want him nah getting ganyu normal banner get weapon again LOL do you have free SUs want to take jap 1 with me? anyway next sem my CAP will definitely drop to like 4.46 or 4.48 prob will get B+  T_T Yea Possibility lor I think can get A- But later MKT B+ Or IS mod B+ Nuuuu You alr safely FCH I taking jap btw Life skill is forever You taking ah hellooo ok la I tell you im actually gay im attached alr :D hehe tinder helped nope we just got together ytd during our staycay this is our 2nd meeting ya we met on new year\\'s eve yea haha i only identified as gay last month he\\'s really nice in terms of interests, he likes coding and investing during our first meetup I missed my last train and I went to his house so that he can drive me back cuz I dont like dicks and I\\'ve never liked porn actually ian knows this but he\\'s acting only LOL so im kinda asexual but romantically gay darren not bcos im not close to you but darren also does other stuff which I shall not disclose im like the emotionally gay kind not really sexually I fell in love with this guy who was attached in RC then I was damn sad when we moved out of RC we mostly just cuddled and slept tgt and had meals tgt, showered tgt once sighhh but thats all over now yeaa I thought he liked me that he will break up with his bf nah he does shady stuff but he\\'s nice nope yea whatever he says is true but you should also infer what he does not say to be fair... I cannot confirm this cuz he knew I was gay without me telling him looking back it\\'s kinda sus he doesn\\'t also... we just play league on voice I found a good bf alr and I still talk to my ex-crush so I guess just go for dates he is also rich, so we can easily buy a house tgt for me, a partner is a lifelong companion, someone who I can share my life with thats all it is tbh im quite a low level commitment guy HAHA girls might be harder so much expectations on the guy but so many more girls gay community small, so I swipe 50 times got repeat alr a lot of trash tbh ppl who are clearly ah bengs, ppl who are clearly in it just for sex ppl who look unattractive it still took me quite awhile leh the guy I crushed on was damn attractive he\\'s nice, really smart, also had the same sex interests also from rc4 plays board games haha was referring to my crush the guy im with.. I think he may not be as smart but is smart enough, but he\\'s fitter and knows what to do in his life he\\'s our age, but is year 1 :( yea his personality is good at least which is an impt factor I decided to share if I get attached cuz I was still finding then nothing official yet anyway I share individually, but everyone in the group knows la wahh I can tell ppl who post a lot on social media are the ones who are loneliest I actually confided in a christian pastor cuz I volunteered for his organisation in JC he\\'s also a counsellor and he helped me a lot in my early depression stages just talking lor I couldn\\'t eat for one week I was damn sad cannot be together with my crush cannot eat meals everyday and spend time together we spent like all our waking hours together last sem was really good I felt like I was in bliss I think thats how you know you really love someone after the sem ended and we moved out yea we\\'re really close friends still we just met today for D&D his bf is 31 yrs old he\\'s 23 I guess love transcends age lor anyway im also not his type so we wouldn\\'t really have got together anyway or rather im almost his type, just not tall enough sometimes it\\'s looks that matter also but not only that, it decides whether they choose to be with you cuz you can\\'t really change looks also haha just take your time I guess you can do it la you tend to underestimate yourself a lot same as my crush says he\\'s not smart at all :( you know I wanted to be a scholar last time cuz I thought I had the academic qualifications so why not right but I proceeded to fk up every interview ohh just say you like the work hard play hard culture of shopee HR is just a screen though, should be easy you want to work on more customer-centric features more projects rather than \"business as usual\" metrics I think I asked you before and you said you rather work on features than metrics yea but I don\\'t think PMs follow through the entire chain also not unless you work in a startup my team looks at search queries with low accuracy and then goes through a flowchart (bad case analysis) to identify the root problems of these search queries then there\\'s a dropdown list in a google spreadsheet, and we fill up the problems the spreadsheet is then sent to the developers to check, before being deployed in code this is done using google apps script (the one I sent you) yea I mean someone coded it alr so I just need to press button LOL but the guy who coded it left alr prob not but good to know for sure I did some python automation before I left SQL is impt bcos need to query lumos to see which queries have high search volume to calculate the number of potential orders, so that we know which search queries to prioritise but google apps script would probably be better cuz we work with google sheets often yea definitely it depends on which recruiter different recruiters have different PM roles ian wanted search & rcmd but she didn\\'t have crystal gave me a choice between search & rcmd and data product usually it\\'s only 2-3 choices I think idk actually she didn\\'t she\\'s from SoC BA actually no... woah nice did she mention lidan or zhongnan Yep hope so! I meeting her soon sia ahh so it depends on the team lead :/ wanna see my bf nahh we havent take yet he\\'s camera shy yes yea haha I just want this to last he\\'s going to bristol in sep cuz he studies there but bcos of covid it\\'s e-learning yep we hit off very fast tho like our interests all align we met on new year\\'s eve matched on 30th dec probably next week im semi-staying in RC like unofficially uhh it\\'s not illegal it\\'s against RC rules at most RC4 LOL just hope I don\\'t get caught early as in room? nope he\\'s staying lor I have a friend who decided to take LOA last minute cuz he just got a 6 month internship and he alr paid the $200 deposit yea but I doubt im at the very top of the waitlist la tbh maybe im not even up there :( did you apply PGP at least >_> stay with darren then tell me what he is up to he keeps telling us cute lolis right cute little girls darren likes cute little girls yea then you know what he is referring to when he says he is a toxic alpha male? like specifically what yea what weren\\'t you there :P the last time we met at timezone do you think ian is gay he doesn\\'t show us his tinder profile even with me and alex lau cuz he knows im gay normally if you meet someone else who is gay you will feel safe to reveal right at least for me thats the case he says he\\'s straight true maybe he just has high standards are you saying that gay ppl are ok with anything :3 gay community really quite terrible tho everyone is just horny looking for sex you have no idea how many times I swiped left on the same person cuz they recycle oh ya thats true also my bf keeps telling me im adorable :D it\\'s easier to like a guy who also likes you maybe he\\'s bisexual likes cute girls/boys but your social media a lot of guy friends wait then how\\'s your current date coming along oh no girls are so difficult to deal with maybe plan a staycay staycay = sex and I think usually if you know the person well enough sex seals the deal my one time experience yea my first bf I never spent much effort on relationships in the past I mean can be just cuddling btw don\\'t need to do hardcore stuff have you at least cuddled before? then previous have ah what did it lead to wah kissing for guys is actually quite high level my crush was willing to do oral but not kissing cuz kissing is reserved for his bf is it above oral sex though how about handjobs then what is low level sia back massage? ???? I felt like everyone would quit... Ohhh Shag is your resume geared towards ML? search logic is ML then the other team leh? :( wahhh it\\'s like the HR wants you maybe hiring season over alr I heard that they stopped the split team and it was super crowded cuz they hired so many ppl over covid period did you ask for supply chain the one ian and alex are in I think not bad sia, can go for business travel I wanna get away from singapore sometimes rack up SIA miles ._. prob is zhongnan he usually look for very technical ppl so maybe product ops is full, and biz degree not good enough for search wahh this sounds like a straight no though I think just go for BI then change later there are a few zai PMs in my team who are also from BI maybe you alr passed these >_> I think just go back BI first bah can always change later What else happened? go watch the good place if you have time yea >_< sounds like a misunderstanding on the HR\\'s part .______. so you need to go through BI interview also? damn.... when is your interview just watch some shows and pass time it will calm yourself interview with your ex-boss? I think it will be alright la since you know her alr with other companies? or shopee roles maybe the HR don\\'t know :/ go with this first cuz they will have to offer you first then there\\'s a lot of time even after you accept the offer, you can renege before you sign the contract you need 5 mods right take jap with alex and me why leh if it\\'s on zoom I feel more confident I\\'ll be in RC then I will practice speaking japanese to my senpais practice with me! and alex and can come over too play dnd with me I feel so blessed I was very depressed last month then I found stuff to do everyday over the holidays :( you have friends can be like me no pretences i think I feel much happier that way in the past I used to keep to myself so much im sure you care :D like when I first told ian I was gay he was so accepting actually all my close friends were quite accepting lel but there\\'s a lot of toxic masculinityh especially in NS when everyone talks about girls and you just have to play along it happened during my exchange also everyone just keeps talking about girls but after creating tinder I was quite surprised to see a few of my friends so there\\'s a certain connection yea thats what I\\'ve been doing do you think im attracted to ian yes no I crushed on ian for quite long but he doesn\\'t know that actually you\\'re the only person who knows ian and knows this I tell my other friends who don\\'t know ian I used to la got over it for some time alr with relationships or career? hmm for me I just want someone to share my life with you know im quite needy also I always have the need to talk to someone but sometimes some aspects of my life shouldn\\'t be shared with friends so I needed that kind of outlet I treated ian as that kind of outlet in the past but I realised it\\'s not the same as if I had a bf nope so I met this year 2 guy who I know since y1 since we\\'re in the same IG I liked him, asked him out for lunch, and found out he was gay we cuddled later that night even though he has a bf and I spent a lot of time with him eating all our meals tgt and sharing a lot of our lives but alas we cant be together and I also can\\'t share with ppl who know him cuz it\\'ll be weird right imagine if ian was actually gay and we\\'re in a relationship then I tell you all this \"actually ian and I cuddle every night\" yea haha I bet this kind of thing is quite common just that you don\\'t know I like this too but for girls a bit harder cuz they expect to be taken care of right I felt this way too :( in work I\\'m always chionging doing stuff but in my personal life I want someone to take care of me Stop putting up a strong front Cuz it attracts the wrong kind of ppl imagine if the world ends soon all our hard work will be for nothing if we don\\'t enjoy the present should I spend $300 to retrieve data from my dead phone? I just realised maybe darren likes you no leh cuz sometimes he goes nellll or iannnnn What number Woah What did she say If you get 5k will be higher than all of us Then it is the same it\\'s rc4 ok haha not really im sharing room  first few weeks I just phantom first no cuz my friend doing internship LOA so he doesn\\'t want to stay all days im the 90% occupant yea he moved alr but he\\'s bringing an air mattress he isn\\'t staying for this week actually it\\'s damn sus sia I know a lot of ppl here yea I would think most ppl wouldn\\'t care la unless I very suay meet the prof at night :/ I like it la this kind of living my family honestly quite noisy can tell the difference once in awhile is ok but everyday it gets on my nerves can hang out with friends I\\'ll bring my monitor desktop setup and tea stuff this week then try not to bring so much alr doors are not soundproof RC doors are actually better at blocking sound lol nope my bf\\'s family also doesn\\'t know he stays in holland v so nearby maybe in 5 yrs thats where I will get my own house downpayment for condo really not cheap it will wipe out my savings about 250k but I will feel much freer or I can try to hit 500k around 32-33 then still have capital I hope sti and dbs go down next week DBS went down ya haha woah yingjie\\'s friend actually did data science at shopee yea her experience is so on point the DOS prof isn\\'t so bad btw in terms of strictness for DOS? DOS3811 I like data viz LOL uhhh nooo BT is good DOS boring af he use all the classic examples jack ma alphago google culture I hear until sian alr Ok yay Do you actively manage But now alibaba price movements not high I thought the EV announcement was huge your NRIC isn\\'t it good opportunity though damn im fully invested now 5k my expenses yep I dont think stocks will go down la no but tiger is cheaper to convert no it\\'s not it\\'s immediate idk but I changed sgd to usd maybe I should keep some cash after all... to scoop up if the price falls I just went in thinking it will be bullish I bought alibaba 2 days ago and it\\'s up 6.6% but AMD is down 2.7% apple is down 1.07% at this point idk at what price I will sell if any of these suddenly shoot up, I think I will sell can alibaba hit 300? or is that too greedy I put 10k btw I think my range is 20-30% you\\'re planning to top up 10k for tiger right o.O whats your net worth  tell meeee thats at least 25k alr ok but it\\'s after you start working alr 2025 abit agressive leh... did you count properly in 5 years, I project I will get 330k 8% annualised returns and 10% salary increment hmm maybe you got a lot of money now i guess :P May 2022 I will have 83k only >___< yea true and I set at 8% just to be more realistic but I wanna get better growth nah I don\\'t like to lose money I think as long as I invest in good businesses, I\\'m safe can get 15-20% apple revenues growing at 11% and with their product lineup, they are too big to fall trueee but they\\'re making money yes cheaper than MCA nope it costs 25 sgd to withdraw in usd but free if you withdraw in sgd charged by banks, apparently I lost about 55 usd while converting 20k sgd as compared to the actual market rate so I will probably do some calculation if I choose to withdraw you can pay 25 sgd to withdraw in usd but my 20k in sgd is like my play money so I will keep for long-term use I just started 2 days ago see how it goes in 1 year lor honestly timing is more impt than decisions ohhh maybe DBS is free I saw wrong then thats good uhh I don\\'t want to leh 166 usd which is what I have what do you think of palantir I mean gamestop also when I sell alibaba lor you need to actually buy sth to use the stock voucher btw but they credit as cash their system kinda makes you want to make more trades I just got 5 free commission trades which one oooh how do you find all these sigh 2021 may actually be a bad year lor for investing but still should stay in the market sky high prices for US tech stocks + economy is not good but I strongly believe that tech adds a lot of value, so their high prices are justified it\\'s like a new paradigm did he sell I think my satisfaction threshold quite low lol not greedy to 2x take home is definitely lower plus spending so marginal earnings matter a lot did you claim the free 5x commission-free trades in the rewards tab? ok good I forgot to claim before buying :( apple AMD alibaba yea 1.99 usd x 3 will rise tonight my target is 300 though 10k trying to get the short-term gains cuz im extremely confident on this one from what? I got no time to research too much >_> anyway I will take a 20% profit then buy about 3-4 other stocks I guess 228 YAY maybe reinvest in ARK and CQQQ honestly it is more guts than brainwork does the market really think jack ma will be beheaded? nahhhh he is not that impt also hmm you bought at what price? do you think I should do this? I should focus on my core skills LOL and not trading my other bets are apple and AMD keep 8 units alibaba and then reinvest about 10k into ETFs how do you outperform ark I think paying 0.7% for active management is ok spend my time on other activities making tea, playing board games, making my website, my 15 per hour RA job and learning japanese ahh that also my bf invests and exercises not very often tbh we met last week tues actually we only got together 2 weeks ago still friends? actually it\\'s just 7 days LOL anyway if my alibaba stock hits 12k, I\\'ll sell 10k worth, buy 4k CQQQ, 3k ARKW and 3k ARKF ARKK is like ARKW and I think I prefer ARKW maybe I don\\'t value physical tech as much but what do you think though? I\\'m still learning it\\'s very very similar — both ARKK and ARKW got taiwan semiconductors and nintendo contemplating ARKG also... what should my allocation be? ahh ok nah idw play around too much my fun bets are AMD and apple prob 2.5k in CQQQ, ARKQ, ARKW and ARKF 2k in alibaba since CQQQ got no alibaba actually all the ARK very similar idk if im actually diversifying why leh I don\\'t really understand ARKG anyway commission free.... and I can\\'t decide LOL their fintech one is quite new anyway my alibaba target price is 282 I put in slightly less than 10k cuz of unit size LOL to hit more than 12k sgd I have 32 units 270 now is it like pre-market? what is the next stonks stock??? alr shoot up leh maybe I will try adding what you say to a paper portfolio idk I won\\'t put anything idk anything at all sia at least for alibaba I trust the fundamentals so I can go long if jack ma is still missing why is it good ohhh are they earning profit biden likes renewable energy right 10k depends on your net worth also is 10k like 20% of your net worth? by who so high and yet so reasonable maybe I put 5k then the rest in ark? but the ark ceo said will have some correction :/ thats why I asked right I think thats a good reason I\\'m also quite risk taking but not at the wallstreetbets level to buy GME LOL hmm why? in the short term only I like the prospects though if alibaba shoots now I think I would sell I think can go 290-300 nope my mind is a blur woah did you put isn\\'t it 2.59 now? maybe you should go in with more oh shit btw how do you see pre-market data? I can only see in tiger not apple stocks or yahoo finance LOL I got onto wallstreetbets recently realised ppl are more stupid than I think ppl are putting their real money I\\'m just afraid they cause a bubble they\\'re partly the reason why I don\\'t want to put money into PLTR is it overpriced now? I like their business model they are like apache spark + tableau/powerBI + python mixed into one software very good data software going to revolutionise things nope, I haven\\'t sold alibaba yet I only got like $160 in my tiger account when do you think alibaba will hit 280? after I sell I\\'ll just go back to passive investing maybe keep 5k to play around lor I think my financial goals are met alr I wanted to hit 50k by the time I start work is this with aggressive capital gains? >25% for 1 year I mean for all you know there could be a recession this year :(C everyone is too greedy then everyone will feel like we should have seen it coming yea cuz the world is recovering if you look at the rate of how the vaccines are given out it\\'s way faster than expected and somehow it\\'s also quite effective like no bad news yet yea im not like that though :( I take too much time to think but im willing to do the prep work in advance when researching on stocks yea true anyway I won\\'t be broke alos got my RA pay giving me 2.6k for dec not true leh I think I will only have 3k disposable I still need to eat and give money to parents and pay CPF after CPF my pay is only 3.8k I guess CPF is also investments today is so green cuz of biden GEVO is 8.67 now :O ohh how much did you put anyway im not cashing out alibaba so soon I think the next safe play is AMD can be +20%  this is my current allocation uh I still have cash luh I include my 400 bucks in paylah but not 40 in grabpay >100 can include lor I also exclude foreign currency im keeping as notes I got about 500 sgd in yen and about 800 usd woah thats quite aggressive then if I include pay from work can hit 90k without investments I scared make mistakes it should be the same la you probably mean if you have 100k it\\'s easier to make 50k than if you have 50k and you want to make 50k why leh but if you want to 2x from 100k you need to earn 100k if you want to 2x from 50k, it\\'s only 50k hehe help me get 100k maybe by May? :D I will earn about 5k from work RA work keep track lor how many stocks you own sia hmm then why do you say it\\'s spread too thinly? investing is also working what is your net earnings from capital gains? thats a lot.... thats how much I earned as income for 3 years leh true if I put all my capital in Sea can 4x by now I am ashamed of myself even idiots on wallstreetbets make so much more money than I do but they may not lose at least they don\\'t leverage or short I guess maybe once i hit 100k to 200k i can transition to safer bets why? do you think keeping 6k is too much? what do you think of TIGR you invested all your cash? wahh why shopee accept so many outsiders ppl who never intern in shopee before gonna be so crowded in office ya lor  blame alex we need to do more gatekeeping as former interns  these people don\\'t even do tech actually pm not very technical but my team is supposed to be quite technical what is xinlin\\'s background wow nio how are you so rich ok maybe considering you are older....  can hmmmm i will put ark what is game wtfff explain how about ark what is currency burning the returns so good meh why won\\'t everyone do it how about Genshin be a 3rd party seller i spent too much on games without profiting the pre market always much higher good for selling then buy when the market open yea markets rose too fast im in this for the long term yea alibaba not bad nope im patient LOL the stupid reddit no la it\\'s stable at 40 well it\\'s too late now don\\'t believe it will go to 420.69 or whatever nonsense ppl are spouting your other bets are doing well what GEVA and TELL true natural gas! this kind of profit is pretty good alr you know my situation right I want to buy a condo it\\'s the logical outcome 1. I don\\'t want to live with my family cuz they are too noisy and distracting\\n2. I am gay so I can\\'t BTO not until 35 lor by then I wasted all my youth suffering alr :( also I have a bf so can\\'t bring him home he\\'s also closeted he\\'s actually kinda rich LOL maybe can buy togerher same as me about 40-50k  his family is rich live in holland village bungalow and his family trades actively, although they stick to SGX (idk why tbh) I convinced him to set up tiger brokers anyway much better than most ppl our age la and his mindset is pretty much aligned with mine frugal spending + realising the need to invest early how to be greedy yet contented huh I think im greedy for money but contented with how im leading my life  hungry* maybe don\\'t see stocks for a few days then focus on these activities :D enjoy y4s2 instead of living to regret when starting work can one avoid menial stuff like meetings, avoid conflicts and drama do whatever you think you will enjoy the most try not to stress about stuff beyond your control are you still using tinder? can try lor I found my bf through tinder sometimes just need to meet the right one gamestop is 45 wow also apple is doing well should we buy gamestop also? nope idk tbh seems like good support at 40 at 40, no one will sell so one way to look at it is that the publicity might drive the price up, but not by much maybe can hit 50-60 in the short term this sem hard to do well sia  and I need 2 A- maybe PLTR is an actual good investment you can do it1  my expectations for this sem is like 2 B+ if I can 2 A- it will be a miracle im taking 3 this sem yep! + 4 IGs interest groups still commitments I guess im doing 2 RA jobs too to earn money whats this oh DOS3811 which you dropped maybe PLTR and NIO but no $$$ when hit 280-290 this is just market manipulation sia should be soon earnings report on 2nd feb food coma now :( should I nap should just stay in the zoom right then reduce volume :P I need to be more productive though do my RA work and work on my personal blog work is sometimes enjoyable you feel a sense of achievement I guess programming test :P I used google colab extensively for my FSP is it break time now? so quiet haha don\\'t fomo so much I guess stick to principles +20%  it\\'s still going up  I should just sit by and watch apple and AMD doing well alibaba is stable at 260 yea we can see a crash coming soon big correction yea PLTR definitely worth more can easily go up to 60-70 next year woah meanwhile im still keeping safe(r) stocks yea hold it for the long term Geva not really idk it\\'s your call haha same HAHA but it\\'s gotten to a point where even serious traders buy it $57 :O some ppl were sure that GME would go up today bcos a few institutional investors had short positions they need to clear just wanted to see if that would be true LOL  are you fomo lol  will it hit 100 tonight it\\'s fun and painful to watch knowing that if you knew how to play you can easily double the capital you put in within a few days ahh how much would you have put in? you definitely wouldn\\'t put 50k la can switch to safer investments and retire alr yea I guess as long as you have capital there will be other opportunities and the market doesn\\'t crash so bad 2021 will be pretty volatile LOL in a few minutes it could tbh I don\\'t think it\\'s as risky as it seems it had good support at 45 people won\\'t be selling at 45 so if you buy now, you probably will only lose 33%? well.... the ppl on wallstreetbets are pretty dumb so they won\\'t be selling same patience lor but if there\\'s an opportunity like this I will jump on faster time travel 3 hours back and buy GME at 42 :P is it on wallstreetbets? no need ppl to buy + a lot of attention to shoot up like this we\\'re just trying to make instant profits LOL I think it will be 80-100 today I also said this haha maybe I should have bought 10 stocks I just dont want to sell my current positions yep  my friend actually bought but didn\\'t sell he got it a few days ago though +87% about $500 small bet I guess oof 61 :O if you\\'re fast enough, can you just take advantage of the volatility? back to 73 halted again? im just watching from tiger brokers now the reddit comments are toxic my friend sold he earned 500 sgd oh? same T_T I still need cash to fund my keyboard hobbies if not I can eat caifan everyday how do you find all these stocks anyway r/stocks? the rewards are kinda lousy though mostly xbox crap btw your picks quite on point tell sava and gevo will you hold for long though or sell now GME too late already it is going down after last night the people who are invested won\\'t see much movement then they will slowly sell is it too late to get into palantir their patience is thin should I sell my netlink and mapletree no it\\'s safer (?) 6% every year I guess plus some potential capital gains I didn\\'t see for about a year alr the price is stagnating yea it rose from 0.83 to 1.03 before covid in about 1 year then dropped to 0.99 during covid and is now 0.96 dbs is abnormally high look at alex lol challenging the prof the prof was saying how NASA spent 1m on inventing a pen that can work in space then alex called him out and the prof defended himself by arguing that he just saw it on the internet like some boomer someone else commented that astronauts use grease pencils in space so there won\\'t be a risk of sharding then I said that grease pencils are smudgy so spending 1m on gravity-free pens might be helpful after all, since 1m is nothing compared to their space exploration budget yea cuz pencils are fragile and if they break off it might get caught in equipment the prof damn salty though idk if I reply I will get class part or get into his bad books anyway PLTR seems like quite good I think so despite the sharp rise last night, it has good long term potential and good short term potential if GME goes to hell >_______< I also hesitant if you have 50k now just put all in 1 stock that can 2x then you have 100k alr assuming it takes 1 week to 2x then you just need 5 weeks I have 40k need to keep cash to feed myself but it also works I will have 1.28m hmmm I need to inject some capital maybe I can afford 2k take out from your cash pile just need 5 months by then will have job maybe buy on Wed sell on Fri??? Monday to Wed will drop also is it possible to sell a bond before maturity i have 1k in SIA bonds idk why  i think can cuz interest rates dropped? yep gonna play board games tmr and spending today with bf ehh a lot of ppl say GME is still shorted so the price would probably still go up BB is also interesting but is BB heavily shorted? not sure it\\'s in one of the reddit posts BNGO? sian no one likes alibaba :( maybe 265 was the peak I hope I can sell my SGX stocks in time set up my FSM account alr, so still waiting to link to CDP need to link to CDP tiger no CDP yea wait it\\'s 3 days??!!  thats too slow sell:\\n\\nnetlink\\nmapletree industrial\\nSIA bond\\n\\nbuy:\\nGME (short term??)\\nPLTR\\nBB :D split 10k sgd in each not sure when can double lor I\\'ll take small profits cuz im a pussy I think if GME +30% i will sell liao but PLTR definitely looking to sell around 100+ in the long term they have good software that is better than the competition yea thats why buying for long term is just like how apple is fking overpriced now but im quite sure they will go up until the market crashes how do i get bloomberg for free :( NUS don\\'t have?  nope free 😩 another short squeeze apparently we saw how it\\'s like on fri do you wanna try? ohh hmmmmmm objectively speaking what do you think the chances to make money from GME look like when will it get delisted hmmmm has any stock been delisted due to market manipulation by retail investors before? but now with media attention I think it\\'s a good chance to earn a quick buck I\\'d be happy with +20-30% on 3k I just need to stay up, and know when to cut losses if it ever drops I think 80-90 is reasonable btw I\\'m not too sure about BB as a long-term bet also I only like PLTR plus, given how the wsb mob works they are probably focusing on GME 3k I think but I\\'m ok with smaller margins yea trying to make sense of this I think the probability of GME going down is quite low the only risk is they get delisted or suspended for a long time yep definitelyt probably a suspension first 1 month ago :O thinking would you?? then try to sell in the first 3 hours i thought you have 2k or is tiger referring to the stock that\\'s fasr idk leh I\\'m going to hold gme for 3 hrs only how much am I willing to lose though i think if gme falls it will just keep on falling maybe 500 i put in 3k GME bah no one is giving attention to BB depends on the float right what is 1/29 btw is it a call option?? like they bet it will be 115 by 29 jan right but if it hits leh X is what nope mapped it they never teach this the prof very old school the kind who will buy Macy\\'s for investment but greater risk right nah 30% is good yea im a pussy oh im liquidating about 11k worth of stocks and bonds so i just take out from my emergency funds for now i have 6.4k anyway more than enough it might drop to 40 then i lose 1k ya I read hmm so you think I should hold? im scared though i cannot sleep while holding cuz the US market i have 4 only 45k me too tiger is so good free $70 i have 10 of those for now cuz i never use cuz some of my so called friends sign up but never deposit wew  are you buying sell some nio it won\\'t rise tmr from 3x ah 30* or from current price Woah yea i heard nio is good LOL just buy and keep la but tbh if all the retards buy gme then the price surely will increase if i bid the premarket price will i get it as in what price should I bid for or queue for it will fill ah ohh shit I scared the price I fill damn high will it be what if they say I buy at 90 ok I feel like the demand is gonna be high both are good but I\\'d say GME if you\\'re buying tonight low chance for GME to crash because MMs have shorts to cover right make the money on GME now and pump into BB later true but given the high public sentiment and the strong united front they have I don\\'t think GME would fall below 60 it probably won\\'t rise that much bcos ppl would cash out from 60-90 maybe we can see +30% today? realistically speaking la long-run maybe can hit 100+ but im not waiting so long it\\'s a CDP thing yea and you don\\'t know when it\\'s gonna rise right if you\\'re really risk taking and don\\'t mind losing all your capital can put 50k in GME  it\\'s all about risk-reward heh I\\'d say GME is moderate risk, high reward? high risk, even higher reward can help me understand this I want to find information that contradicts my current view and what would that mean exactly? how do you get this number? can\\'t believe mapletree ind peaked at 3.28 in nov last year now it\\'s 2.87 it was always above 3.00 last year, should have sold man I think STI is doomed 4.8k netlink and 4.82k mapletree I bought netlink at 0.83, now it\\'s 0.95, mapletree at 2.50, now at 2.86 so not so bad lor lmao I topped up 3k, and now my tiger got 3001.97 tiger is generous June 2019 it\\'s about 6% div yield lor yea nuuu wtf I cannot change to usd during non-trading hours siao the rates are crazy oh well experience I guess hmm maybe gamestop will dip? aiya can go either way right im stingy 2247 vs 2255  ok la I lose $8 ok withdrew hmmm I just scared won\\'t withdraw in time but at least it\\'s free and I can estimate how long it will take in the future yes what if the price goes up to 420.69? ok hwz ppl say about 20 min anyway I think I will sell once it\\'s about +30%? lets hope I stick to that target and not be too greedy ohh? how do you know when to sell? for something as high-risk as this? I should just stay up all the way ah or sleep and hope it doesn\\'t crash? what would you do if it\\'s your money? thats not very rule-based haha it\\'s like based on emotions will you stay up and watch if you put into GME? hmmm looks like it was a bad idea  I need to do bank remittance to deposit USD im trying to transfer funds I cannot add tiger brokers as a receipent oh ok nvm can do one-time transfer USD 2,279.01  im not sure leh is it like this im lost LOL ehh if I fund this way will take 1-4 days leh :/ it\\'s not viable LOL then I can just currency exchange when the market opens yep it was a bad idea if I change back to sgd and send and then change back to usd it\\'s a lot of money wasted should I sell alibaba I\\'ll sell 3k worth lor you want to borrow ah :P I think alibaba won\\'t rise tonight so it\\'s ok! nvm bah I sell 16 lots of alibaba and put all in GME it\\'s 5k+ :)))) yea I can\\'t transfer the DCA thing makes transferring from DBS MCA to tiger very easy should I just sell netlink and MIT now? sold SIA bond is 1012.96 minus transaction fees fk u  2019 March ehhh I can\\'t make orders outside of trading hours yep I think need to do the orders during pre-market sian then I should have converted to USD in tiger after all no selling BABA what? ohhh welp what price do you think I should enter? 70? im not too comfortable with buying at 80 now :/ BABA is up too at least I got to sell at a good price wow BNGO also maybe pre-market is a bad time to enter? or it depends why is pre-market lower volume during pre-market, are shares actually being traded? icic okie why not GME? usually you use limit order right to set the price whats this ok I bought 83.5 how does the price setting work at pre-market? how can it jump +20% so quickly? I wanted to buy at 60 :( 50  93  hmmm how ah when to sell what is 115C options? if I\\'m more greedy i would buy $20k if there\\'s another gamestop how much BB did you buy? don\\'t think it will climb that high leh hmm?? what was your price? hmm ok I\\'m betting that MMs need to clear their short positions sure if we broke how how to do a stop-loss why do you think this is the case though next short squeeze ah eh when market opens ppl will offload right??? cuz some ppl can\\'t sell before market opens right  50/50 ok i will bet on it do hedge funds trade premarket? i feel uneasy for gme at least still got a moat i bought at 82 now is 92 rounded up 82.5 i drank lots of tea  woah that\\'s quite high i thought you went in at 17 GME dropped below 90 but still went up so support is 83? cuz that\\'s what most ppl bought at when the premarket opens ok i should set if i plan to sleep i set 76 bah 88 you know why nio will do well this year? bcos it is niu year i hope i can hit 50 next week 50k yea hope to get 4k from gme yea fml my friend told me at 30 but i didn\\'t know yea now there is too much publicity randos are going in one wait until 10.30 man i had tea session  whats the diff? how do you check this? how to set stop loss limit order?  basically saying or below is it should I sell now? it\\'s 100 I earn about 20% I drank tea so not sleeping tonight alr how do you know thissss is it the websie or bloomberg WSB? :P for BB? I thought you say BB long term icic gme is hovering around 100 120-130 but if around 12-1 am it stays around 100+ I will sell  is it like this? actually I don\\'t feel like making a loss nahhhh I can do whatever I want but this is correct right im actually autistic  yea I mean there\\'s nothing stopping me from wanting to not lose money when the premarket opened in the positive direction yea it\\'s a psychological thing HAHA hey AAPL and AMD doing well no PLTR is not exactly meme though their software is revolutionary and I think they can become a big tech firm like microsoft 10 years down the road none of the big 4 have specialised data software yet can just sell order your price target right stop loss sell is sell when hit a certain price but it must be going downwards suspended at 87.80 damn tbh I think 100 is a good time to sell alr short squeeze is too optimistic? anyway I\\'ll wait till 12-2 like this won\\'t definitely happen with the rate that ppl are selling cuz it needs to be a coordinated effort should I sell order at 100? yep kinda stable it\\'s like waiting for the ppl who shorted to cover their positions a game of attrition btw I can actually sleep I put my stop-loss above my buying price can eat taiwan fine food 20 times for free it\\'s not much hoping to sell $100-110 I feel like 100 might be a psychological barrier it\\'s also possible that GME alr made its run or can go to 200 as you said, if some hedge fund buys a lot to cover their short weird i sold stop loss 85 i sold at 86.7 it just triggered it probably did when you selling tell stop loss stop limit is when trigger limit at x price then sell at y price i will set it to be the same anyway maybe i will buy PLTR i fked up though i could have just as much sold at 94 instead of earning a small profit looking at the prices now i never optimize well just an experience i guess yea im not going long but dang it my stop loss is a bad idea should i short gme? haha you should have bought gme nope luckily i cannot short your friends sell alr? my bf sold at peak 155 16 ok luh not too shabby 1.3k sgd (155 - 90) * 16 * 1.33 anyway i bought pltr not a meme stock hope ppl pump in their gme profits wait why is pltr negative wtf BB also yea even your stable stocks right yea maybe i should cash out all 120 GME value yea 36 maybe that\\'s too high it dropped to 30 and i was so scared im getting a treat from my bf though yep i just scared there will be a sell off GME rebound???? your bb leh are you gonna sell do you believe in the fundamentals or you just think the wsb ppl will go over once gme is done sleeping?? yea i warned you about it don\\'t set high stop loss should just take advantage on any volatility GME had good entry at 60 now is 90 you can do it multiple times i bought 95 sold 100 then when it dropped again  i bought at 95 then i panick when it dropped to 60 now idk if i want to call it quits yes I was very sure it would crash but it rebounded I think too many ppl short I sold another 16 units of BABA at 261 yea PLTR is doing well even though I got in abit high I think can hit 40 I got in at 36 should have waited for the opportunity at 31 ooh good buying opporunity what do you think of this like we hold too long you should be buying at 17 and selling at 19 but for gme I should have sold any time it hit 100+ and then wait until 90 do it consistently (over the trading day) and you can get 10 * number of times you do this * number of units 10 is 90 —> 100 it wont lor 1.99 commission I had 50 units 250 usd free for 95 —> 100 if you do 90 —> 100, it is 500 usd I need to offload my 95 LOL nope it went down . I was too scared to sell ironically cuz if I sell at 60 I lock in my loss I didn\\'t sleep well lol haha I got 100 bucks also from my stop loss I think thats a mistake btw you want to sell at the higher end of the range not your stop loss I could just as much sold at 95 or 100 1 time caught on too late 250 if you know the range of what it would trade at, then you can easily do it dunnid to wait until 150 no lor if I sell now I even out I bought another batch at 95 I think 11-2 is the peak trading you should sia while there is still a volatile stock you can take advantage of if I could short at 125 that would have been great also even though it climbed to 155 at one point, it crashed a few minutes later to 90s then sell at 90 how to create margin account though actually I shouldn\\'t bah just trade shares the thing is, when it hits in the 120+ range you know it will plummet even if it does hit 1k at some point, it WILL crash and you have a lot of time to cover your short and if it hits 1k, it\\'s the end alr, ppl are just gonna let it go to 20s need to pay ah so at 125, I would have correct to short the stock (on hindsight la, but there\\'s a good chance it wouldn\\'t stay there or higher) would you recommend me to do it? btw how does the 115c calls work ah so once it hits 115 they get the $$? like doesn\\'t matter if it falls or it has to be on close pls explain :( do they get their money? ok next time knowledge is power I just want to learn do you think BB will pop today? but you sold alr hor what if BB +20% during pre-market if you want to experience thrill, yes I think I had enough I want to cash out and sleep soundly put in nio see the premarket lor I hope it\\'s high then I can cash out first do you really think can hit 500? I think 200 is reasonable if pre-market drop to 70 join me :D if it\\'s as volatile as ytd can play also lor I think reasonably, buy at 60/70 correct! then sell at 80-100 if it spikes it spikes lor but if you can consistently buy at 60 and sell at 80 it\\'s gonna add up you make more than someone who buys at 80 and sells at 120, only once then reinvest the profits into nio I wonder BB will get the same treatment as gme though I guess it applies for me then put 5k? sigh I should have sold at 130 buy at 90 again then sell at 135 easily 8k earned >_< ok fine I guess my main mistake was selling too low at 86 cuz I could have just as easily sold at 90-100 the stupid stop-loss then buying at 95 was also a mistake it depends on the volatility also right :/ today need to be careful fewer ppl interested in gme alr they made their profits so the trading price may not be as high but we\\'re saying that many ppl have shorted the stock and need to buy I bought at 95 :( ok true it won\\'t be as volatile as ytd also I think it can also come crashing down yep yep should I do this hmmmm ok if the price is good I will I mean making 200-300 per gain is good if I can do that every night and by 200-300 I mean like avg lor accounting for losses also do you think your sava, gevo and tell are fair value or overpriced icic whats this haha he started with high capital la I reach 1m happy liao :D I really think stock market will have some correction just that idk if it\\'s across all companies apple and amd seem pretty safe maybe microsoft as well? google gained a lot in the recent days actually with how much we\\'re putting right there\\'s a lot to lose I just wonder how much can apple fall and if it falls will I exit fast enough how do you know though what is noise and what is an actual crash yea man 20% so what is the limit :/ that would have been a good opportunity to enter still cashing out my other stuff yep maybe we gamble this but the sentiment on wsb not there alr if it tumbles down volality alone cannot make money :( then again if we wait too long the opportunity may be gone and it only gets riskier I think day 3 alr fri was first day rmb it was only 45 what do you think the trading range will be? how do shorts work it depends on the broker right when they want the shorter to cover 6 days hmmm it\\'s week 3 he got template one fill in the table for the parameters for a tableau chart variables\\n\\nsort by\\n\\n???? basically breaking down a tableau chart into its elements he will teach one it\\'s easy except last qn last qn need to think hard I think 70-90 I\\'ll be happy with 2 or 3 successful ones no it\\'s only 21 it will be 40 next week I just scared pre-market crash then ppl will be scared alr :)  woah it\\'s quite positive la, I will hold until I make a profit :) 94 wew it\\'s just $2 man lmao? I sold at 100 I put the order ytd sold just now idk how premarket works man someone must have bought it 25 min ago I got the notification ok at least got profit idk what price to go in I think just wait wait for 70-80 I think today\\'s range is 70-100 idk how I actually sold at 100 but it\\'s all good I made a tidy profit also 100 was an arbitrary number I set last night idk what was the max gain I could have gotten anyway I think buy around 60-80 im not sure how low it will get lor but 60 is damn safe idk maybe 91???? or stick to strategy A yea wait for low price actually is this the price to enter yes abit high but it didn\\'t go down no my guess is that most sell-off will be from 10.30 to 10.45 87 now it\\'s dropping idk 70 +? should I have a position in BB? im not that greedy luh it went up eh yea go for it suspended I queued 50 units limit i got oh you\\'re fast you selling for 5s ah 50 units = 50 usd per dollar change can do $2 increase 100 times tonight is 10k with just 50 units if you got more capital can I sold at 93 ye today is just not very volatile yea yep true hor but it might suddenly spike leh how does the trading volume compare with ytd I never noticed eh the system cancel my order for selling maybe sell too fast kena flagged but dropping now :/ not easy sia honestly too dangerous yea when are the shorts due i see 93 suspended tho actually am i satisfied :( am I going to bet that the short squeeze will happen how much you put btw like how much are you doing this margin trading witgh I mean like using the volatility to profit ok I made 6.7 * 95 maybe 95 units abit scary yea man I was scared I sold AMD will there be another 80 —> 90?? there\\'s good support at 60 anyway and tmr can also trade since the shorts are not covered yet so I think... as long as I build a good moat im ok are you doing the trading thing now? am I waiting too long to enter :/ like when I waited so long until it hit 86 then it fell to 81 and I was sad or should I be patient about this looking at this range, what is your ideal entry price and selling price great advice :) should I do half half buy at 85 with half my capital I suck at timing lol 95 now I was waiting for it to drop to 85 dunno man im sitting on pretty decent profits I want to earn enough to hit 50k though I just need 1k more :) why put into BB :( nope it\\'s so stagnant RA pay :) 15k+ \"machine learning\" projects wew GME 107 now wished I had a position LOL I can\\'t I haven\\'t changed my account yet I think cannot but I want to own a position during a squeeze :( so I think fri I will have a small position these few days I will keep trading at lower numbers mitigate my risk I just underestimated the prices today it ranged mostly 85 to 95 so it means safe for me to enter at 85 nowww? or you mean buy and keep  I\\'ll just do one more time then try to get in another time at low then keep damn I missed another 115-120 range yea i didn\\'t buy fk me i think no more opportunity oh well if it goes down it won\\'t go up alr right ikr ok la I got 1.4k sgd free I should be happy realised gains also yep 3 I didn\\'t have a position around 12 alr I thought it would drop to 80-ish and I can buy lower I thought the short squeeze might be tmr so I could do my buy and sell first im dumbbbbbb yea my bf bought at 90 sold at 137 again about 5k usd he\\'s so smart I think most ppl would sell now??? this is like once in a lifetime sia and I missed it :( btw right I don\\'t get how come when hedge funds cover their shorts they need to buy all at one shot why don\\'t they spread out so that there wouldn\\'t be a squeeze? icic :)))  yep! I think im going to buy back AMD and buy BB yea after GME crashes where do you think ppl will flock to will there be more short squeeze will you buy GME at 150? his advice is to cash out though cash out of all stocks put in bank maybe just play safe lro if it crash it will crash fast will lose 20% at least idk I never got burnt before maybe if it keeps going up, around march - may I will cash out I mean like stock market crash depending on the price I have no solid strategy this time, but I know I should buy some dh lor but if you want we can go eat udondon then after that im going clay sculpting at 8 but I don\\'t think I can focus LOL rc4 my bf came over last night I introduced him to gamestop nah he drove home the bed too small he managed to convince his family to contribute to his gamestop he\\'s planning to put in 20k >_> I feel like as long as shorts need to cover, the price will go up it\\'s just whether ppl will hold at what price I have ascertained that it\\'s stable at 80 and there\\'s good resistance at 90 so wait for pre-market, see what price i can enter if it\\'s 200 I definitely wont buy I have no position for now it definitely wont crash to 60s so if I can buy at 100, I will put 5k I think 100-115 is pretty ok? why now though? and not sell off during aftermarket before 9 am this morning yep I agree it can go up during pre-market also then I definitely wont buy fking elon 148 to 200+ is scary region definitely wouldn\\'t touch 130 I might put 1k? im quite fomo but I think I got accustomed to it alr this isn\\'t this the case for everything im quite sure I can make if I buy at around 90-100 hmmm nope im not fomo about the stock I actually think I can make money through the stock than other options if the hedge funds need to cover by this week, and havent done so, they will try to spread out and it\\'s likely that wed and thurs night will be most of it, so they dont have to cover last min on fri I just dont know the right price I hope it plummets premarket idk how to find accurate information these days traditional media is biased reddit is biased I actually keep track of the prices it only went below $90 for 30 min or so last night the ppl who are holding likely bought around 90 also in the 80-90 range so they probably wont cash out knowing that shorts need to be covered this week I don\\'t want to touch gme on fri yea imagine shorting it at $4 ohh I thought some hedge funds were shorting at $4 like trying to crush it steal from the rich uwu yea idk how they keep track tho LOL for US citizens RC4 do you wanna come I can ask ohhh HAHA it\\'s just moulding clay then baking it I want actually hungry now >_> I shouldn\\'t skip lunch clementi and buona vista have I don\\'t think have yea?

i have 340 units now up from 280 im just trading the same capital i just want to trade volatility but i realized the commissions higher it is 3.4 * 2 now this is how tiger makes money trading volume sold i like it stable enough to do this consistently oops 21.50 yea amd collapsed lmao i sold at 95 5k worth now is 90    multitasking amd is below 90 now wonder if this is a new bb equilibrium but i won\\'t take chances i don\\'t think it will pop today:( maybe idk my gut feel is no because I\\'m scared and i don\\'t think i will have the guts to make such money 17.4 now sometimes ppl don\\'t make sense wait for opportunity i wishes i got in at 12 now instead of 11.60 17?? yea maybe i will go in at 12 yep need to be cautious man yea same im looking to play amc also what does trading sideways mean ahhh can go in at 15 i will put 5k max didn\\'t know cannot market order during suspension 16.5??? woah is that above your price target wow yea i was thinking anyway should i go into sava or tell also or gevo i will have fresh capital soon ok amc 15.50 i went eventually i will earn 6k usd and i can use profits to trade ok i will put into amd and tell long term should i just buy at 15.50 and sell at 16 6k usd  sold 16.24 limit 325 usd woohoo pltr it is actually quite volatile wow i think he won\\'t is it time to buy at 16? bought no it\\'s not it was at 20.50 yea i bought at 20.50 and sold at 21.50 or sth oh no below 16 i selling at 17 i could split between amc and bb also cuz I\\'m hitting the threshold for the commissions 1.99 usd min is 1.99 usd but the stock is so small I\\'m paying like 4.60 usd per trade oh lemme check pltr almost 40 no leh  no just showing you the commissions wah amc was tumbling to 14.80 oh shit wtf hedge funds shorting dammit no capital maybe i should put half did you get in??? what price? wow how much damn i think 16 too high 13.8....... wtf it will go back up la fking shorts wsb will never short eventually will have funds injected why what if gme constantly stays high bcos of shorters nope of course not lmao ok can\\'t wait to inject new funds about 10k sgd then other than autowealth, my stocks will only be in tiger he is he put 20k in AMC damn baller 16 his net worth is pooled with his family I think his family trade on the scale of a few hundred thousnad last time he trade on SGX only but ever since I intro him to tiger he has become more ambitious he\\'s quite patient to watch the price go up also considering he told GME at 155 when it peaked at 159 last time but is also cautious enough to take profits he definitely has more experience than me which one ohh just give it time lor now just a few $$ this time, I will trust it will go to 50  yea must be someone shorting the stock  shorters never learn their lesson true ah there\\'s only so many stocks ppl can focus on おやすみなさい idk leh AMC won\\'t be GME v2 cuz it\\'s not being shorted as much I\\'ll still leave a position overnight I guess I like to wake up to postmarket gains now eh how do calls work ah we can\\'t buy 115 calls now right is the profit lower? but isn\\'t it guaranteed or sth to be above 115 icic but how much do you get how much do you get? from 1 call? could be big tmr I mean +100% is nothing for a volatile stock if i buy tell i pay so much commission yea 17 3.40am idk how to buy now amc is cheap nio is cheap bb was $18 at 8.30 now is 22 i saw pltr rise to 45 i sold at 40 i bought 6k of amd i think it is a good price im not sure about nio and tell sia wsb got taken private idk if we will see the same premarket price action this time we were right cuz wsb got taken private and not allowed to post on r/stocks do you think amc can rise again? or should i have bought gme cuz the premarket has always been crazy ok sounds good bb leh i think amc can squeeze maybe 14 can oh fk I should have bought WSB got taken private but is now back I didn\\'t go in it\\'s gonna shoot  up.... hmmm ok anyway didn\\'t manage to get PLTR at 36 I think it\\'s the next stock to watch yea I think trading long-term stocks for the short term is good cuz you can hold if it goes south I should have bought some nio at 56 is it cheaper to transfer then sell in tiger if you want to about the same if I average 2.5k per trading day, I can hit 100k by next month yea actually I did 1st day = 1k\\n2nd day = 1k\\nytd = 2.5k but this is USD hor also risky if I use more capital leh can diversify I guess  they move to telegram no one can shut them down alr gme is gonna hit 500s not sure leh there is good upside for sure wait for premarket under 300 i buy 10 i will do you think nio will go back to 60+ today yea imma short term person it\\'s ok if we hit 100k soon im at 54k now AMCCCCCC I regret not buying I think premarket can +100% my gut feel like now do you think will be +50%? premarket today haha I will put like 12k usd im quite aggressive with capital but not price target I kinda want to buy TELL but commissions hurt I like to buy stuff I understand leh so maybe trade apple and PLTR HAHA uhh $20 to buy le.. usd okok I have a price range for a few stocks i think amd is cheap now I will only put 6k into meme stocks at most so I will play 6k into amd, apple, etc AMC again, see price yea man see the range first but just assume it will be the same or higher lor don\\'t miss opportunity if it looks low enough I feel like thurs ppl will rush gme it will actually go up so 300 is kinda safe but it\\'s so scary right it\\'s safe yet so overvalued if it goes down 20% I won\\'t sell bcos I know how volatile it is then idk when is the peak man huhu 15 good? or should I get it lower BB go down quite a bit I want to get in is BB good $20? i got in 19.75 erm im still in class wont be monitoring 19 is rly low can try sell at 25 greedddyyy nio is 53 wtf I mean opportunity cost bah 8% only it rose so much alr BB selling price what pre-market major correction sia rushing my prof to give me money LOL how much you put alr I really dont believe tho the sentiment is kinda neutral preparing my timesheets idk if I should be greedy and claim so much even though my prof verbally says can I\\'ll probably check with him when I meet him about 2.6k for dec \"difficult work\" I\\'ll probably need to spend a lot of time to figure out later, it\\'s just easier to claim more in dec bcos of the limit what are your thoughts on this? what and what price look at gme but the % gains marginal for what? LOL now is 5.30 right I shouldn\\'t have went in AMD and NIO if I wanted to trade hmmm these days ppl go for the hot stokcs ohhh sounds reasonable hmm should have bought AMC at 15 ooh how much you put sia aggressive but the market cap is huge right I have 313 units of BB sitting on 857 profit now technically I can just sell and call it a day heh you\\'re ahead >_< not next week la end of feb I put 23 for BB then I can go into NOK wah but NOK market cap is huge can reach 800k by end of year? maybe too high 400k NOK is the one listed on NYSE right damn buying GME at 292 would have earned me 20% you think if we buy GME at any price now it will still hit like 1k+ on fri then still can 3x also what is SPCE depends on what price you buy at lor but I guess $300+ is too much for me to stomach maybe time the purchase of GME with the short interest? what do you think? help me get free cash still money you can login to yours also I\\'ll click hmm gme is 400+ alr.. click on my link, login to your acc then send me the url btw im not too sure about NOK it\\'s not shorted sold BB at 23 done earned my 1k today alr idk if I really want to go NOK  oops I let go too early you said short GME at 420.69 but it\\'s beyond that alr how are the shorts gonna be cleared ah logically someone has to step in hedge funds dont have that kind of money right but if govt steps in then it\\'s not fair cuz individuals are allowed to become bankrupt and die but hedge funds need to be saved?? I don\\'t think it will end up well la I mean melvin capital is fked alr la bad publicity and prob need to shut down for good thoughts? HAHA everyone is too divided after GME wow what is the buying power of russians anyway i only buy into the meme stock thing cuz of the short squeeze what about SPCE?  AMC actually climbed a lot alr $20 should be considered high btw gme very hard to move the volume very low cuz no one is willing to buy or sell is it Russians can only trade during market why though gme is such a niche stock wtf? TD is Canadian right i hate trying to predict which stock will go up but i think NOK is stable oh it is rising is it too late for nok on what basis???? ooh nuu it is up wait i bought 5.7 i didn\\'t see good 1260 sounds good no one wants to miss out rise to $8 :) yea wtf why whats going on i playing game oh shit ok wait for market i guess wont ppl go to tiger make a tiger brokers account yea i made 1k usd from that can nuuuu wrong call yep that\\'s OK Nokia is gonna be stagnant tho gme might rebound? but i won\\'t go in yea can\\'t hit 100k alr sian yea you can\\'t buy now PLTR and AMD can maybe it\\'s a logical conclusion yea i know about this my bf told me that somehow the MMs have to cover their shorts peacefully not trading today the volatility too low im holding on AAPL, AMD, NIO and NOK interesting discussions now on twitter if there\\'s no volatility I need more capital to trade right how long do you think it will take for nok to recover hmmmm nok banned i heard on robinhood i cant believe they never ipo yet but tiger has NOK is artificially surpressed now it wasn\\'t even going to shoot up $6 is +50% it shot to $10 meh ooh I think can just wait for outcome of the robinhood thing sadly they have no other commission-free alternative in the US right and luckily I set up FSM actually just wished they had a better UI like tiger I believe FSM and saxo can but I no money to try do you think i can still employ my trading strategy for AAPL buy at 136 and sell at 143 the margins will be smaller and i might miss out though...

41k sgd maybe this is the bottom ;)))  yea i always thought fully invested is good now i feel abit pain yea sell all buy pltr 24 or maybe i stay up until 3 i think lowest alr??? when is after lunch low is 24.5 idm 25 sell aapl same maybe i should set an alarm if it hits 23 maybe i all in maybe you sleeping ah somehow bngo is still 13+ insane 193m trading volume it was a prisoner\\'s dilemma game whether we think ppl will sell today or not yep that\\'s why i bought some at 28 after the initial crash yea when is that i guess so day traders ah I guess so im not too sure also but I hate pandas fml??? same im too tired now.... maybe but what if drop to 20 at 5am always got that kind of nonsense planning to buy and sleep at 3 25 might just be the bottom very strong support im trying to see why this might be a bad idea the pltr subreddit is quite cultish but I think it\\'s just boomers don\\'t believe in pltr and maybe many ppl shorting for a short term profit ooh I see some recovery wsb no money alr their money locked up in gme and they refuse to sell honestly PLTR will stagnate a few more days if you know everyone is selling today, why would you want to sell today if you know you can get a better price next week? it won\\'t shoot up so fast I think this looks like the bottom alr at worst, 23? yea by next month, at least 30 how much you buying are you gonna sleep? tiger and cloudflare surprisingly resilient tesla also idk nio went down 5% like everything else I thought tesla more overpriced than aapl but I think the ppl who are buying up the corporate bonds are the boomers, who most likely held aapl ppl who own tesla wont suddenly sell to buy corporate bonds just bcos the yield increased EV but thats still ages away I guess aapl is just a cash cow idk how many units you buying? should I buy 500 more? make it 1000 la nice number I have 525 now almost hitting 25.... filled ah I blinked haha it\\'s like they are so disciplined yea haha it will go up to 30 still considering I want a good price!!!!  im a baller :D sorry ARK and aapl I will buy you another day sian if I timed it right could have sold on tues then buy more now if it hits 23 I can buy 50 more :P is this 1m?

$30 fri next week may not even happen :( thats the fear lol but how to sell calls covered calls need margin ah yay wait it\\'s just a red day :( yea he did ytd that he will keep interest rates low right near zero at least alex karp is keeping most of the selling is still attributable to inside selling incognito Lolol idk time to short???? margin right how does it work of cash ah wow ok nvm sounds tough oh yea it is risky could go up further my bf got 2k in gme 60 i said he was crazy haha lol i finished it long time ago no no just 7 how does this work in simple terms?  hmm i roughly get it but not really like if all the stocks in the etf go up but everyone sells the etf what actually happens?? but what if ppl don\\'t i see look at nok wtf buy BB?  oh no pltr is in red zone lucky i never buy any calls should have sold calls how will i earn 1m then will be quite safe right if price goes up, i can sell lemme see quite ex though eh $31 gme calls are only $14 so as long as it doesn\\'t fall below 45 i can break even right tmr oh cuz no one selling right yea sad should have bought calls you think it will happen a 3rd time? ehhh how about i get $3 strike price just for tmr i put 1k? no ok nvm i try using my paper account i treat it like a game yea my account can\\'t trade options everyone loves a lottery ticket if i go to 10-40 strike the multiplier is higher but i need more to break even wtf i cannot even buy options on paper account yea damn lame i alr wrote in even though i start work in may i have the evidence writing calls for pltr tmr is like free money sia I can cover 1200 units 5 cents per unit leh $30 strike I\\'ll still earn my cost basis ($27) —> $30 right if it is exercised $25 wow ouch if I write call options I will earn 5 cents per unit right then lets say if tmr hits 40 the buyer exercises I need to sell him x units at 30 5 cents yea if the price doesn\\'t hit 30 then he won\\'t exercise then I earn the premium righgt  I have the shares what as in I don\\'t earn lor :( covered calls but ppl willing to bet that.. it is the bid price right what does the x133 mean must write in 100 lots i think i mean 1 lot = 100 units so need to write in lots of 100 actually not bad leh every week can get a bit of money if the price is stagnant I think pltr is a long hold.... so it will take time can just make safe bets and earn small money $50 is still a lot to me can put in other things I\\'m doubtful that pltr will go up oh I mean if I write 1000 units at 5 cents it\\'s $50 if it hits 30, I still earn like 3.6k usd 1200 units * 3 then can find other stocks like nio, amd and aapl nope sighhhh ehh wtf I thought pltr strong support at 25 where is mommy cathie yea she will still hold on prices don\\'t matter to her keep until 0 buy more at 15 yea oh no tiger :( nio also  whats this 23 alr...... same your other stocks leh? ahhh actually pltr is holding up quite well?? i bought a lot at 25 my avg cost is 27 only bcos my initial buy is 34 but then i made the mistake of buying 1k tiger at 33 lol now is 23 luckily i only had 1k i think tiger will be severely affected by a market crash sian my salary won\\'t come in time interest too high  hmmmm this guy is a day trader facebook some acquantance uh I know him JD is china ecommerce wonder why not BABA though hmm why is feb always a bad month :( yes do it 120 only but now abit high where are we hehe true but can\\'t sell now cuz it may actually the 13 can never time it properly you either earn a lot on GME (low chance) or lose a bit (high chance) expected value should be around 0? 19? nintendo gonna go up today yea omg dpp this is big niooooo pltr needs to break 25 lol they still haven\\'t responded for my temperature taking thingy yet should I wait until 1st March (the given deadline) I sent alr on tues I sent the first one last fri yea it\\'s just too slow alr it\\'s as if you need to have connections to move faster kinda how it is in the real world, but never expected to experience it in NUS im surprised r/nus got no one complain yet or nuswhispers can\\'t be im the only one right I mean wait until 1st march before I send an email to dr helen not sure if she might be able to help me but never hurts also I can find her in her office lol oh?

like I have 1200 PLTR, \\n\\n35c is only .16, \\n45c is .9\\n\\nI can write 2400x calls for 45c instead since it is so unlikely to hit actually maybe not good cuz I won\\'t have the money to cover...  maybe 32 for this fri I\\'ll be happy to sell at 32 this fri sentiment on PLTR seems pretty high AAPL calls don\\'t seem as attractive maybe I should do a comparison with other stocks in terms of call premium over capital invested then reinvest the premium in other stocks i would sell pltr at 45 anyway LOL even 35 if it hits this week 50-75k I mean I earn base of 48k a year XD + employer CPF + bonus - income tax oh wait I actually earn 57.6k a year now I just need to wait for my options trading to be approved but that one should be easier should have checked earlier >_> got contract what ya but they still approved it I sent it when I applied haiz I feel like not writing covered calls earlier is a massive loss of income :( only if I learnt about this earlier... take advantage of highly optimistic ppl actually why is it so high 0.86% weekly if the sentiment remains this optimistic and it\\'s guaranteed to earn cuz even if you get called, just buy back or switch to another stock the risk is loss on your capital lor but if the price remains relatively stagnant it\\'s all good LOL sigh this is better than bitcoin mining  that can\\'t be true right I\\'d consider your horse racing working also side projects is working side hustles is work yes I mean my RA work is similar then might as well define working = work at retail or F&B lol my total from working is about 25k lor including intern, side hustles, RA and part-time jobs at BBA office and LTA and NS but in NS I never saved much lol I was retarded HAHA buy anime trash and go for concerts :( about 15k from ang bao and allowances then about 16k from investments pretty normal leh most ppl around my age who stay in RC get about 15k-20k also ian doesn\\'t do side hustles also he has about that much your allowance so high >_> I didn\\'t get overseas pay it was sad I tried to get silver for IPPT for 200 but I got 74 :( the only extra money I got was marksman honestly in NS I felt quite pathetic couldn\\'t really excel in any way or do any significant self improvement ahh unfortunately I had no such opportunity in army everything was just about waiting for ORD for me doing extra gives me nothing I think the only thing I did well was to remain mentally sane and stayed fit (relative to my peers) I mean in opfor most ppl just sleep all day I mean I also had nothing to do but my environment was pretty lazy so we hardly gymmed :( I was also pretty lazy la no excuses for myself there I only become really hardworking after meeting ian I mean thats pretty normal but bcos im driver and my crew is only 3 ppl I can\\'t do that how come you have car haha am I the kind of friend you wantr I guess so I didn\\'t make many friends in NS either I mostly kept quiet the only thing I liked was playing chinese chess ppl could play quite well before uni I was a really boring person I think ahh I played pokemon but I\\'m kinda alienated from the community alr after not playing for 3 years+ most of them still play but with covid, no more free travelling I must say earning actual money is more fun now back then I was working so hard for travels worth about 2k only to me, that was a lot of money yea we\\'ve reached that stage in life I mean some ppl get NUS merit is still free money but I don\\'t feel that bad about not being a scholar now but the journey is also impt leh I felt I missed out on a lot in my youth] yea haha I mean I had no regrets in sec sch and jc except joining npcc cuz that was useless I think I met fun ppl generally yea singapore\\'s education system is so divided I\\'ve never been to neighbourhood schs but I can see why it\\'s bad I feel like im not in a position to comment bcos of my privilege though I rmb always feeling like I could have done more if I had a better studying environment, parents who pushed me more, etc not really leh money is nothing without sophistication and I actually grew up poor, cuz when I was in pri sch, my dad was in coma for 3 months and had a major operation during that time, my dad\\'s business was also just starting out his income was like 2k-ish my mum was a housewife so I think around that time, my financial state was similar to yours and he had a lot of debts at that time to clear cuz the operations were expensive yea but that one is merit I never had any tuition after graduating can you see yourself enjoying life more though? I actually can\\'t I feel like adulting is too hard for me havent found that true meaning in life yet like ppl who pursue their passion and actually enjoy the work they are doing maybe esports lel what do you enjoy doing?

options got approved seems like ppl are starting to be more pessimistic about pltr the premium was like 0.24 for 32 ytd now it\\'s 0.07 :( write covered calls thats the plan right but the premium quite small now ;_; the spread quite big actually should I just wait  this is how it works right? wait wtf tigr options are crazy 3/19 — 30c — 1.70 pltr is like 3/19 — 30c — 0.59 even aapl calls give more bang for buck aapl is 126, pltr is 25 but aapl +10% calls are about 0.50 pltr +10% calls are about 0.05 doesn\\'t match up aapl is 5x the price of pltr even nio also after the price dropped, it\\'s still doing better than pltr ._. the volume at 30 is very high I think it\\'s like the benchmark lol 28 is 0.13, 30 is 0.07 thinking of which one I should go for quite a big difference sia eh weird they say my cash/buying power is not enough even if I own the shares lmao no they don\\'t recognise that i own the stock it is not programmed into their app can\\'t they just don\\'t allow it lol oh wells under 100k need to pay how much ah thinking of IBKR alr costly  1 contract = 100 units so if I get 0.04 premium = $4, they take 0.25 hmm actually it\\'s not bad zz calc wrong 25 cents off $4 is a lot 6.25% of my profit tiger is 0.95 per contract actually thats worse >_> yea ok IBKR is better so much for going to earn my cai fan money today sigfh with tiger, im incentivised to sell contracts at a later date\\' 2.99 so im going to sell 12 contracts anyway  yea it\\'s ok la 2 weeks is good enough in terms of stability and frequency    nvm bah I just do options my net worth is 50k and my annual net income just inflate a bit lor 40k usd mine is like 70k sgd if include cpf if contracts are so expensive I should buy long term  it is so fking ugly  UI is bad technology bro I can see why ppl say tiger is good now after having tried FSM, vickers and this I kinda wished tiger let me do covered calls sigh it\\'s definitely not worth liquidating to increase my buying power    futu cheaper than tiger but I think deposit is slower I think I won\\'t go ahead with IBKR also the interface sucks too much idk if it\\'s gonna be a pain to transfer since I feel like it\\'s gonna take awhile also  POEMS is damn sus  they need to hire a decent frontend developer this is quite interesting there\\'s no other alternative I think next best is TD robinhood shld come to sg but if im restricted to only buying options, I can\\'t earn premium right :/ I hate it I wanted to earn sth on my pltr shares cuz I know it\\'s not going anywhere for a long time I spent a lot of time last night signing up for brokers and testing accounts is it worth the risk transferring to IBKR 6 days deposit -.- IG is not bad have you heard of them? their representative just called me lol im actually not sure if I want to make the switch  how ahhhhh how else to make money if the price is stagnant all these are difficult options to pick from :/ I could just hold and not think about it too I could sell and buy in IG what do you think? will the risk be worthwhile? sell covered calls actually sian... singapore don\\'t have many options 1. high commissions\\n2. bad UI\\n3. bad deposit times\\n4. limited stuff you can do anyway if I do 1200 units each time it costs $11.40 on tiger so maybe better to do 2 weeks the commission-free trades don\\'t apply to options like right now, 30c expiring next fri is 0.24 so 0.24 * 1200 - 0.95 * 12 = 288 - 11.4 = 276 it\\'s still quite good imo much more than my current capital I probably need to liquidate 60% of my assets to do it safely but it means I won\\'t be holding much and I can only do so for like 400 units :/ which is totally not worth    online chat feels damn bad I\\'m not gaining money I should I don\\'t fully understand CFD to use IG as my broker  not very attractive also IBKR? what do you think? no :( commissions too high is it I just want to buy PLTR, keep and sell call options every 2 weeks  it\\'s ok it\\'s alright! welppp should have overloaded and started working this sem HAHA then won\\'t be so affected by covid shit and can earn money I think shopee was much less strict when we were interning also like some days I also never declare my temp when im in office from now until I start working I won\\'t have significant income which was why I wanted to sell pltr calls :( but tiger don\\'t let me can help me figure out.... can\\'t be all brokers are trash right im sure there\\'s option traders in SG who have figured out is it IBKR oh shit tiger is 22 wtf i bought at 33!!!! yea but damn lame lol whyyyy yea true but their UI is so bad ibkr will allow me i think do they trade options? I wanna learn from someone teach me the ropes dang should have kept some cash  yea tiger so low now maybe i should average down like in 1 week ya sia im down 40% actually i think its price gains are not justified but it is still a good business what do you mean though oh welp  yea it is ok feel the pain now to know to keep money in the future haha wow those who bought at 500 lmao ark bought pltr last night ahhhh I guess come back in april and see how also wed last week was the same but we can do other stuff like learn google apps script I actually have more money now from side project, RA and allowance should i..... 2k I will put 1k LOL あした tiger maybe sea hmm sea is pretty resilient yes HAHA interesting ehh but you need the spread right i need to put in money i have 11 usd oh just buy penny stocks ah not yet was doing japanese preparations kudasai is wrong oh ok nvm it\\'s just a more polite form I always thought ください is like \\'please\\' gambatte ne! is more casual no yet it\\'s at 5 haha we practiced the exact same pic but I forgot to say my name lmao yea 3 min only like perfect except I never say my name while introducing ネルシン wtf I think my bf is stupid he keeps calling pltr trash and gme a good investment help he\\'s like messaging me everyday about pltr he bought mostly bcos of me I feel  during the sell-off it was at 25 and he didn\\'t buy he bought at 30 then it dropped back to below 25 lolol yea haha helpz my relationship is at stake here yea if i can sell call options i should switch to gme and sell but now too high im too scared to enter haha i think it had a safety net around 40 the context of the stock is also impt i feel like we should not judge it with tinted lens since our main goal is to make money why is it gambling but it is not a coin flip right technically speaking price movements don\\'t happen because of chance but ppl buying and selling I think the main argument against it is that it is a bad stock and will eventually go down so it is a bad hold in the long run im just taking the view that if you got in at a low price it is possible that you could have held and just sold calls to stupid ppl and this might be a viable strategy for the upcoming months fair point can\\'t sell covered calls though and the price alr dropped i think ppl are starting to realize it is long term no leh depends on when also do you think pltr will hit 30 next week yea but 32 is good also for me easy 6k how do i educate my bf he is planning to sell pltr for gme  yea true i don\\'t think he is stupid but he is not a smart person either maybe i go sign up as instructor at hackwagon do you think I\\'m good enough 100 per hour for 3 hours on weekends 1 month earn 2.4k more connections and can teach python mostly connections i guess SDSA shut down alr last time vincent hired ting wei and I when we were mere y2 students why is the open interest for a 20 put so high  put leh it will just expire it is outstanding contracts why would anyone buy that pltr trading high now do you think theres an arbitrage opportunity ya true im not comfortable with trading at this price I feel that the stock is so undervalued that I will miss out on potential gains if I sell now 15? but probably not bah tigr is a good stock just quite volatile and feels like a pump and dump in terms of the stock I mean but the company is doing well they have much room for growth as the other brokers suck I was quite sure pltr will drop to 24 when market opens lol I guess I didn\\'t know better good thing I didn\\'t sell thats why I asked this but im really not confident so might as well take average returns than not earn anything at all  I was rightttt got some pattern here ? for what oof tigr market crash incoming? cuz of fear I guess damn I just lost another 1.2k usd actually im glad to have all-ined on pltr other stocks are doing worse yea feels damn bad haha  I would have bought at 24 and below  :(  Haha why 18 :( i wish i was ark just need to invest dunnid to think when 23 is support right oh wells i made 1.2k last night i sold at 25 and bought at 24 maybe it is wise to take profit yea technically a 1.2k gain hehe btw did you know chris is blind in one eye shopee ceo he fainted from overwork and lost his vision in one eye wtf then apparently TY got demoted cuz he give too much welfare yea the ranking is like \\nceo\\nc suite\\nhead of ops / hr etc\\nhead of cs / warehouse / listing\\nhead of local region then he got demoted from head of ops and hr to head of Brazil region do you think I can keep doing this? as long as no permanent price changes I should do well right the risk is when it drops below or goes above the current trading range right? hmm for me, bottom is 23, peak is 25 for now but that might change.... yea.... but it can also pay off got the feels to gamble haha since the trading volume is quite high cuz my strategy relies on pltr not going below 23 and not going above 25 no idea I hope it plateaus let me trade pltr at this range I buy and sell at $1 spread for 1200 units do it 5 times and it\\'s 6k usd easier said than done though I mean you probably won\\'t risk the entire thing if it drops to $12, I lose about half I guess haiz I realised im not working hard enough kinda behind in everything I wanted to do some preliminary work for our BT project also wanted to ask my prof if I can increase my pay to $20 per hour cuz someone I recommended for the job got 20 per hour but I a bit paiseh also cuz im claiming full without doing the actual hours the difference is about 320 per month maybe I\\'ll just ask to extend until my graduation date argh should have taken the RA job from my prof I think the pay is 40 per hour but I just won\\'t really like what im doing  same prof I gave ting hui this one for prof jussi im working for prof nav now (my rc one) uh I took prof nav\\'s one first he is super chill and doesn\\'t care whereas prof jussi is quite a workaholic AHA he expects you to reply 24/7 so maybe the pay is kinda justified he kinda shaped my work ethic yea haha and I worked for prof jussi for 3 yrs alr since y1 summer lol  :P thought we\\'re going to deep learning haha I realised he doesn\\'t release the slides before class oh ya CNY ok this lesson can just passively pay attention  definitely tested  I don\\'t get this? X1 XOR X4 refers to the hypothesis in the earlier slide right ok got it he never explain sia :( actually all this alr covered in DBA3803 and I kinda understand the additional content is the ensemble models yea haha  luckily I never sign up LOL I thought it was $10 per hour and was partially interested they\\'re literally paying $2 per hour open day biz ambassadors  whats going on ah short + high = success\\nshort + medium = failure\\ntall + medium = success\\ntall + low = failure  hmmm this one quite straightforward right just formula bond yield went up again? read somewhere oh wells middle of correction \\'Just sharing my thoughts only...\\n\\nUS Treasure yields up again yesterday because the bond market which is a safe haven is down and this happens when fears build up in the market that Fed will hike the interests rate. \\n\\nInterest rates are key to equity markets especially tech stocks as they run their businesses on borrowed funds. So stocks such as tech, EV, renewable energy, new start-ups get a heavy beating during this market correction.\\n\\nThe fear of rising interest rate also cause a pull out of funds from equity markets as many investors borrow money to invest in equities. A higher interest rate makes equity investment less attractive and less profitable.\\n\\nThe first 2 weeks tech stocks already received a beating. This week as more funds pull out of equity markets, tech stocks get double beating. So we can expect tech share price to continue pulling back.\\n\\nAs long as these money does not return to equity market any time soon, we can expect stock prices of companies that run their businesses on borrowed funds such as tech, renewable energy, EV, new start-ups to continue to exhibit bearish symptoms.\\n\\nAs markets continue to evolve, we have entered into market correction. This market correction is a short term event. It normally happens when markets sense a bubble is building up. A typical market correction happens at least one a year. If fast, it may take 3-6 weeks to get over. If slow, can take about 6-9 weeks. During this period, we can expect the daily trading volume to be weaker than normal due to a number of reasons.\\n\\n1st, funds pulled out of equity markets and moved to other investments.\\n\\n2nd, some investors cash out and stay at the sidelines until there is signal market correction is going to be over.\\n\\n3rd, many investors have fully invested their funds in the markets. Everything stuck and no spare cash left.\\n\\nMy advise to everyone, this market correction is not going to be over any time soon. But the good news is, we are already in the middle of market correction. You may take this opportunity as a good time to re-group or re-position your investment portfolios. \\n\\nIf you still have available spare cash, hold on to it. Don’t make a rash investment just because the price is low now. Continue to monitor those stocks you are very familiar with and if their prices have reach a very reasonable level, you can either average out or buy on the low. If price continues to go lower, can average out again. Remember keeping some spare funds on hand may come handy if situation turns for the unexpected.\\n\\nInvest safe, invest wisely. My 2 cents thought only....\\' boomer post someone on fb nah im not an expert I just sold off pltr at 24.50 im either very brave or very stupid wei feng also felt it was a bad idea but if I manage to get 5k off the volatility in one day, I think it will pay off I just need a .5 difference to get 600 and do it multiple times I think it\\'s equally risky just holding also leh by doing this, I minimise myself to less than half of the buy risk and less than half of the sell risk as long as the buying price specified in my strategy is lower than the selling price it should hold true ensemble learning is my favourite topic ya cuz it\\'s not covered in 3803 then can work towards my ace trader also for this month nope im just going to trade ptlr lol I think today will be quite red also might wait until 21 or 22 bagging is just averaging I actually think he long got cover right got hard and soft voting lets say got 5 trees, 4 vote yes and 1 vote no then it is yes for classification if it\\'s regression, it is the mean for soft voting, I think different trees got different weight out of bag do i trade nio or pltr that\\'s nio but i don\\'t understand nio ofc not the decision tree one? no idea just fit adaboost and gradient boosting is basically making many models where and so on... until the error is very low bagging is bootstrap aggregation aggregation is basically averaging the results he covered hard voting and soft voting just now right those are for classifiers if you fit many models and take the average, it will lower the variance I just missed the part about stacking but subtle difference I think for coding you should be able to do it just need to be comfortable with reading docs nio trade sideways a lot lol most of it is just syntax btw I did this today yay  not easy sia my RA work but no data so I think it\\'s ok to send I had another data cleaning file also btw normally when markets open there will be a sell-off right ok i think i will wait nio was really low 37.8 hot stock sell at 24.5 buy at 23.5 yea there\\'s huge risk at 11pm nio jumped from 37.8 to 38.60 nowwww lol look at nio i did 23.7 im bad at timing anyway i think i was comfortable with 23.5 to 24.5 i should be patient and stick to it also should i let go of tiger oh lol escalated quickly what price 23 is good XD waiting for it to bounce bounce!@!!!!! ok nvm im just delusional is this a correction or a crash hmmm dang we bought too high im only down 6% :) pltr recovered abit my net worth is 90% correlated with pltr stimulus 14th march GME rose fking memes  whats going on no he didn\\'t do anything yea aiya a few months we won\\'t think of this although would be nice to buy at the bottom today yea will take a long time to grow back pltr can easily gain back cloudflare is down 33% nothing will change i think it is all about timing now is just bad for all stocks same i can top up 2k into stocks by apr trye just a correction bah means won\\'t bounce back :( like in the short term true but pltr is an exception cuz it was  pumped by wsb true ouch yea wtf why? my strategy has a plan B hold if i was holding nok there is no plan B hold until im 80 still $4 i rather keep cash Nok also fell  ok looks like recovery i bought abit too high though lol if i waited could have bought at 21 :( apparently the pattern is\\n\\npremarket: go up\\nselloff until 12 midnight \\nrecover until premarket levels I like both I mean you don\\'t really know what IS is about right I enjoyed 4 out of 5 of my IS mods in contrast, I only enjoyed like 3 out of 9 BA mods either BA or CS in SoC if biz definitely BA I would have gone poly lol I heard the technical diplomas build quite a strong foundation when I went for AWS I was surprised by how eloquent the poly presenters were I think the fact that biz ppl can present better is a myth good choice taking risks pays off I think I would have died if I went to a normal JC alsdo at least SJI gave me a sense of identity and purpose not just another fish in the vast ocean haha I think it\\'s not a matter of passing JC for me I believe I was smart enough back then but the skills you learn in poly are more useful then when you go for case comps or hackathons they can be applied better nowww I think only econs in JC was actually useful I forgot all the math, chem and bio alr would you take an IT diploma though im sure you can do it if you have a solid foundation then grad with 7k starting pay learn some communication skills then by 30 im sure you\\'ll be earning 20k thats the kind of job im aiming for too be super well versed in technology + can communicate wanna learn google apps script with me im sure you will be using spreadsheets a lot right I need some motivation can be more efficient at work ok I mean most work is tedious and boring even zhongnan does tedious work also and he needs to be efficient, if not cannot go home he\\'s the team lead until you get to the C-suite level, im sure learning how to automate your tedious tasks will be helpful I might want to pivot to data science also sia but all the math concepts will kill me ouch im planning to trade tiger pltr and nio next week i think for me i can sell pltr at 24.5 then wait for dip in any of the 3 stocks i don\\'t have a price point though i think pltr 23 nio 37 tigr 19 i just need to do it frequently if everyday i can get 500 to 1000 without losing i still win rmb 50 cent price diff is 600 for me alr right now I\\'m abusing commission free trades yea but I\\'m not actually risking 30k right ok fine i am but the chances of that is low since when the price falls more ppl will buy yes you could i would say the risk is when the stock goes up or down if i had 1m i will just sit on my investments but bcos im not that rich i should just trade actively i mean intraday guesswork i think the only issue is when the stock moons and bcos i always sell when it hits a certain price i will lose out anyway i don\\'t need to know the peak or bottom since the spread im planning to earn is not much do you think pltr will hit 30? next week??? how greedy should i be 1k still interests me then i can hit 1m by the end of year earn 5k a day non trading day today lets go fk that man will it impact your job next time? it\\'s good influence no one will care about your grades yes thats the problem your grades alr got you a job it\\'s like saying your psle results matter you only feel this way bcos you\\'re currently in this stage not really im putting in more effort in japanese which im planning to SU anyway wait you\\'re studying for BT meh wtf which mod? it\\'s useful what like if you do some customer complaint project at least you understand the models better hmm I don\\'t think so it\\'s good to understand how to implement the models yourself as well there\\'s a reason why ppl in data science are paid so highly so if you are able to understand the nuances, you can point out any flaws other ppl who are not as well-versed may not understand in fact, I think thats why search & recommendation needed technical PMs maybe that\\'s from my pov bah cuz search logic is essentially a huge random forest classifier yea do you plan to do data science one day? then your customer complaints is just about implementing the model? yea for sure but if you\\'re really good you can easily earn 20k as a senior data scientist if you come over I\\'ll teach you? :P maybe it\\'s the way it was taught in biz if you took CS1010E with me, you might think differently cuz google app script is not as easy as python ML is the easiest LOL there\\'s a reason why ML is easier than software engineering in terms of code it\\'s just copy + paste just need to follow the pattern split data —> find best hyperparams & cross validate —> fit —> predict —> calc metrics unlike making apps, all the models are already implemented under the hood sure I think I can do the coding part quite easily the math I\\'m still not sure ohhh haha maybe it\\'s later haha oh wellsss you really won\\'t use all this meh like you did some LDA thing right you could be doing some cool trading web app using LSTM models also like the one ian sent in the group it\\'s like for the future when you want to justify a +5k increase in your salary cuz this is not sth ppl can learn in bootcamps ppl just learn basic shit they can only do traineeships and then learn along the way if you want to learn advanced ML concepts, have to do masters alr what is KAM btw key accounts? I guess BI is different cuz zhongnan and lidan have technical backgrounds as software engiener and electrical engineer so I think my jobscope is different from yours HAHA I guess she makes up for it in other aspects hmmm maybe that\\'s whats impt when I start working I need to improve that aspect shopee a lot of language barriers yea I guess im ok-ish in that regard  how to be better I guess I\\'ll learn how to create automation pipelines and make my workflow more efficient then got time to focus on value-adding projects and participate in cool stuff truee how old is she ah but technical ppl earn more given same rank nowadays there\\'s quite a lot of codeless applications also so I guess coding isn\\'t as impt as before but I still subscribe to the notion that learning about deep tech is useful since it\\'s sth that other ppl can\\'t learn as quickly unlike soft communication skills, it\\'s something you can easily prove and show if you want to change job if there\\'s sth I need to take away from shopee it\\'s my personal skills and projects that I\\'ve managed yea lol all c6 whaler stupid americans whats the qn I think I would I don\\'t get it lol ohh wah this kind of drama I don\\'t really like why ppl eschew stories with good plot and nice fighting scenes for shitshows like this human nature is like that la I always think I have 2 sides I have a very ugly overcompetitive side time and effort some ppl don\\'t like that lol  tbh I\\'m toxic in another way maybe that was last time though i think i fixed it already if i want to win a lot i would sacrifice relationships not in a backstabbing kind of way but i push ppl alot like during the aws hackathon cuz I\\'m close to the ppl who i took part with and they are in  rc and i assumed that they would want to win as much as i did so i like to gather ppl in the lounge or go to their rooms do work past midnight but if course I\\'m also putting in a lot of effort myself but looking back it was kinda toxix now I\\'m much more chill if i become a manager next time i hope I\\'m not like that that is an extreme example though like the worst one yes that\\'s why we get along lol im quite demanding myself so if other ppl are demanding i will feel it is normal what if your future boss is like that sasuga shopee managers im not sure about mine but my team lead is somewhat like that better than kavan from reg ops did you get a $50 stock voucher yes go be ace trader idk how i got but free $50 apparently  Lolo what mod is this idk did they teach wtf b i think a sounds wrong queue is not a data structure d is false cuz table form allows for more complex queries financial data is usually structured all tabular form no those are data types data structure is array a is wrong you can do it this kind of mod damn useless cuz it is like trivia e sigh i hate these kind of ppl useless cuz they know what the technology is but cannot contribute add zero value really? what do they do ok bah i mean they do work also i enjoy what i do bcos i know I\\'m adding value i hate Eric sim every time see him on LinkedIn annoying but i will just live my own life he infiltrated nus biz lol  yes but he is invited for some biz entrepreneurship mods it is retarded how much influence he has yea i agree one day i want to see such ppl fall can see one la they are so showy just need to see when they stop ofc I\\'m not too caught up in all this bah  yea i just need to do better than these kind of ppl then i will be happy some weird school also i cant believe I\\'m not earning much above the biz avg though sigh really? but you have many friends who invest also i know more lol he introduced me to investing started with autowealth then dbs vickers and he also referred me for tiger he is year 3 woah poems leh ibkr? maybe once I hit 60k I should diversify with ark rowlet torchic mudkip when you coming to study okie damn I was gonna sell the moment markets open fml nope 24+ drop to 22.7 now possibly just early market shenanigans bah when it is this low it is good to keep I guess I wonder if can buy more.... woah so hard do you feel like you learnt a lot from this mod? it\\'s retarded if they try to test concepts they don\\'t teach btw I think market will crash lol idk if I wanna keep 20% cash or sth it should prob go up when market opens a lot of uncertainty though hmm agreed but pltr has more potential yea okie I\\'ll refactor my portfolio to 3 stocks pltr tigr and nio uwu same back to 23 though i think i will try the half and half strategy see if i can time it premarket very uncertain and low volume should just wait bah unless got money can scoop up like nio now since tiger deposit and withdrawal is free i just incur fx cost right hmm that\\'s just a greedy thought though oh welle oh ya i have margin! 3476 maybe i put 2k temporarily that\\'s another greedy thought :/ on 240 but when i had 40k my buying power wasnt much higher either  isn\\'t it average buying power based on what it was called in vickers i will try a lower value as my cash gets depleted my buying power decreases so it is not 3.4k cuz it eats into my cash first so i managed to borrow 400 my remaining buying power is 700 so i think the max margin is 1100 i can borrow up to about 610 apparently maybe i should put more sgd as collateral to take advantage of the cash multiplier lung is impt maybe sell kidney should i try i can live with $500 in bank right anyway now not low enough for me to go in hmm i recently spent my tiger coins for commission free trades which I\\'m trying to optimize for my large pltr trades ok it works but the multiplier is about 2x 500 sgd gets me 1k increase in buying power apparently it just matches idk how buying power is related to loan it is 5k when im not under loan 200 when i borrow about 900 usd so the max i could borrow is 900 usd i think good enough lol hmm see how the market opens later if i want to sell at loss to free some capital can\\'t be too emotional if i wanna make money buy half then if i goes up i sell so i still earn about 600 on the dollar if it goes down much more i scoop cuz i cant time it well enough maybe i will buy nio at current price yea unlike gamestop i think these shares are good to trade with gme i get so paranoid even at 80 last time cuz back then it was still the start yes oh no it fell again nuuuu i should have sold greedy me why leh should i sell should i buy tiger buy at 17 nio was 35 right if this is the peak i should sell now then i get punished but if it falls i can scalp hehe close to selling price yea i put 23.9 fast trades bro 23.9 !!!!! hmm open will rise ah let go now then? wtf?  huh??? idk leh i wanna let go ok nvm i cleared .92 it is ok a few cents oh no it went up 24 nvm i keep cash ehhh .95 weird i put .92 i just attributing it to low volumw i never did this before yea now 24.13 though haha i will buy more later maybe half at 1am waiting for massive crash tonight nah not certain but the trend is yes yea tiger also but not worth at this price what is this  some optical shop? it had a recent spike when it doubled tiger swings are crazy btw yea have to be patient have you applied for OTC? NTDOY also falling no stock is safe :( I\\'ll wait for the prime time again what is low for tiger though ok quite close lol wah really leh lucky I never fomo go in on tiger at 17.9 now it\\'s around there but seems like a downward trend somehow it always reach like -13% then slowly recover such huge swings tho dont bite yet maybe if I do half I can trade faster hmm I\\'ll be patient! need to set up some automation if stock.price <= buying_price:\\n    buy(stock)\\nif stock.price >= selling_price:\\n    sell(stock) lmao this aapl buffett sold again I think im biting tiger 17.5 I can get 1800 units yea swing like 30 cents can sell alr actually tiger volume abit low... my 1.8k can\\'t clear then need to settle for worse prices hmm 8 cents is 144 usd this ok went in 17.69 yea wtf it went down??? ok la can\\'t buy at bottom I\\'ll sell at 18 yea im chill yea gdi but it was a risk I wouldn\\'t take so im not fomo-ing earn about 540 from tiger I\\'ll be happy :D yea have to be happy about it I thought it\\'ll be easy to trade... if you go to orders —> any order why is it commission-free discount yea  feel a bit scammed lol ohhh wtf man so it\\'s not entirely free cuz if it\\'s 2 usd, then still need to pay 0.99 ok nvm they give me $50 so I forgive them actually this is like my main motivation for earning money then plus im learning jap now I feel like im achieving my dreams when travel ban is lifted alone prob can do bothn bah just need some space alone idk if it\\'s the weather or sth but food in japan is always tastier than SG even the cheap 500 yen soba ya man really need to travel to eat the good food im not even sure I like sashimi anymore sick of donki and it\\'s so epxensive quite often but I eat the cheaper stuff about $7-8 I avoid the sashimi to not overspend btw do you think I should sell off my keyboard stuff or is it just marginal cash ya ok thats true cuz it\\'s one of a kind also stuff you cant buy with money even if you want to pay if not one is selling zzzzz wtf 19.43  wah these stocks lucky I never hold sia TELL and BNGO no telling when it will go up again I want to make my swing trades also the faster the better I think I\\'ll go rest a bit first will be a long night I aim to earn 1k :D idk anyway I\\'m not too worried about tigr alr profitable just that I never catch the bottom sigh just wanted to make full use of my commission free trades after this I\\'ll do 200 by 200 I mean the company their earnings on 24 mar it\\'ll rise up again given the amount of trading activity and the users they acquired can use grayscale as proxy for crypto to me it\\'s the same thing gme is 200 :O yea for sure good to be disciplined I think tigr at 17 is a really good buy can easily 2x im scalping but it\\'s not big enough for me to sell cuz my commissions are high I prob can\\'t do intraday trades well lol need to wait until aftermarket sth happened to Chinese stocks it is ok bah will recover ytd was just a gradual decrease what price sian CQQQ dropped a lot oh ya actually i bought at 17.7 fk me tiger swings are huge though today it could go up to 19 just as easily wah but if i buy at the bottom though..... it is 2k difference I\\'ll stop buying so much just bcos I have commission free alr I\\'ll buy in 200s and average down if it goes down cuz $2 anyway nope i bought using tiger coins i thought it was just efficient yea apparently I have more buying power now tiger is weird maybe cuz I bought tigr instead of pltr my buying power is 66k, cash balance is 768, available funds is 16.6k and interest rate is 0.0078% daily what mac why you buying a maxc oh it\\'s macs not mac  I know thats why I asked should I invest in another keyboard 502 sgd kinda premium cuz it uses a PVD coated stainless steel backplate instead of alu and brass weight I think I fked up apparently commission free and stock voucher doesn\\'t stack and somehow the commission-free is used up  and it is used up also even though it doesn\\'t apply I should go ask how to trust if they will credit though :P all this small money no leh not reflected in the order it\\'s either waived or rebated my stock alr rebated but commission not waived hmm interesting can I see the main page?  maybe waive takes longer... hmm BNGO right maybe I\\'ll wait haha should I just wait actually do you often check all these whether they credit back lol  lol tiger is up again but not selling price yet :/ I should distract myself then time will pass faster idk leh at a certain time when im about to sleep it always goes south usually use domain knowledge it should be meaningful this one is to drop variables if they are highly correlated you can drop can don\\'t drop anything interaction is not impt if you\\'re using tree-based models are you using decision tree? if using statsmodels can just trial and error but im not sure if thats the right way to do it I mean it\\'s kinda intuitive right wind speed affects humidity so maybe try wind_speed * humidity yea usually so can create an interaction variable I feel like tigr at 18 might be a high range >_> what if can\\'thit will gme ever drop wtf  273m Market cap wtf i couldn\\'t find much info woah hmm I still don\\'t know how you got it reflected I think it doesn\\'t reflect for 2 of my trades also   like this why doesn\\'t it reflect? but it used my commission voucher? I feel damn cheated of the commissions anyway I\\'ll just do 200 units each time now it optimises lor so I dont go all in damn dumb lol the customer service doesn\\'t understand there\\'s only one guy anyway the amount is small la just that it is significant like 17 usd just not very transparent lor so based on my theory, it will drop further in the day it\\'s almost impossible to trade efficiently cuz of this trend have to wait until next day market open to sell but if you\\'re patient, can scoop at a very low price earn like 2-3k per day sell now yes I sold alr earn about 500 it peaked around 18.02 I sold at 18 anyway I trade in batches of 200 easier to get the ace trader they giving me enough free money anyway so I wont complain even they cheat me abit :( it was also used this I don\\'t verify if they credited or not la it\\'s too tedious but it doesn\\'t reflect so im kinda suspicious this one was quite long ago and since the commission free is in batches of 5 I know that it was used up I was using all my capital bcos I wanted to spend less on commissions lol meaning? hmm I won\\'t exchange for more alr it doesn\\'t seem worth forces me to trade in larger quantities I\\'ll just save up for the 30 usd voucher uh the rebound is so strong lol I chase a bit make some quick buck when you selling idk if I should buy now today might be different eh fk I think I bought at the peak ok at least I didn\\'t all in pltr 23.98 nio 40    im a joke lol I manage to buy at the peak for 3 different stocks :) I missed on the first hour thinking  yea it\\'s still low to whatever it was before it\\'s not really 53k indeed but not nio and amd maybe it\\'s the kind of trend where it goes up very fast then drops gradually ok earned my 1k now 80% cash yea same missed out on 2k it is ok im hapoy gonna wait for now why is everything going up fk if i just didn\\'t do anything i would have earned more i will not trade anymore you think today will go down? cuz it\\'s a bull run if just trading sideways trading actively will earn more yea lesson learnt i will just manage the % composition next time i was holding cash thinking it will drop yea i should have just allocated tigr and nio most likely to drop righ I\\'ll do like 40% pltr, 20% nio, 20% tigr 20% cash slight regrets trying to trade though I didn\\'t think tigr will go up postmarket especially when it alr rose 17% all things considered, at least I earned >_> tigr high was not justified though but yea it has that potentila to rise further from 20s I can easily 1.5x my net worth :O lolol I shorted tigr briefly but luckily I closed at a small profit it was at 19.80 then I close at 19.50 just trying out yea tesla can easily recover to 800 when will we know it is midday right tues and thurs hmm tonight is Wed for them right why would yields not increase though they need to raise so much if stocks are so attractive then who would buy bonds yea it is risk vs reward i guess but the amount the us govt needs to raise is quite a sum im not sure what to expect today is the bond auction and CPI numbers cpi is 8.30 am\\nbond auction 1pm today is gonna be wild I\\'ll do work study for BT distract myself i still have a short position in nio 42 i put 200 idk what is my limit but i won\\'t go more than 200 if go up by 10 i lose 1k uh i have 200 pltr also the rest cash yea pltr didn\\'t gain as much as ev no one cares about pltr it can go either way i think keep 30% cash tigr has so much potential the earrings is gonna be good earnings* if you look at the trading activity recently they prob earn a lot in commissions hmm that one is platform right tigr was alr profitable i feel like premarket a lot of stocks will drop cuz ppl don\\'t like uncertainty can I\\'m only worried for nio lol not sure why I did that.... it\\'s such a risky move to make for very little gains hmmm it is dropping haha all in on tigr how to 1.5x your net worth in 1 month true he all in ah  lets go tigr is srsly pump n dump dunno when it will go down -.- very possible given what is happening today also good chance it will go up maybe buy abit? is that how you earn average profits shorting nio a mistake :( nopwe whats the inflation ah how to check is that good nio looks scary... wait did it <42 right i didn\\'t no slightly under but it is over a long time i made 2.7k but you know after gme i was up 6k means i lost ohhh yea it did i saw should i close my nio i will lose.... will the yield increase why aren\\'t ppl afraid ok i covered hopefully good call only got 280 pltr now should i buy more hmm  it is too green i scared sth happen later idk im buying more but only abit more can make some short term profit in the first hour idk why but my orders never fill  same shit again i missed the tigr train but got someone selling at that price leh not filled yet wtf same  look at my limit price still cannot fill hope later is a bloodbath :))) but i think during open ppl will fomo and buy wah lucky I closed nio but should have bought more at the same time should I scalp today nvm fast fingers :D I earned 170 pltr and nio I scalped a bit 21 avg for tigr waiting for it to go up I will try to hit 3k net profit today :D I mean before 2 am then I cash out of all positions EXACTLY thats what I was telling nick ytd can jump 20 cents one that makes it easy to scalp though as long as you\\'re patient wheee I sold alr my price targets too small i think :/ I just bought tigr and pltr nice  yea I think ppl will sell off before? yep for sure this nio was 45 just now now 44 43 now are you staying up tonight for the buying opportunity in case yields are low oh you\\'re not selling beforehand ah hmmm wont it go up what do you mean yea if low then ppl\\'s fears are alleviated nuuu im losing 600 my avg is 21 also nvm bah I never all in can buy more sad wtf lost so much value both on the way up and down nvm at least there will be an up pls pls pls yield curve low actually buying 200 units of one stock is a lot >_< I bought 200 3 times for both pltr and tigr yea I slowly avg down cuz it was trading sideways 26  yea I will do better next time must have significant price diff agreed ok at least I took some profit just now fully covering my nio losses + more  5k can buy 200 pltr is this the dip you\\'re waiting until 2 am righgt are you gonna sell your kidney sell and buy now  yea my bf bought at 60 but only abit he\\'s still keeping well he bought 5k at 250 then sold at 50 anyway it\\'ll be unwise to be greedy now I\\'ll just stick with pltr and tigr playing games now to distract myself sighhh I knew it will plummet before 2 and yet I was greedy I know this.... sian I could have been in an all-cash position now major oof my bf sold btw he\\'s not that dumb at least he sold at 312 same I\\'ll buy 5k lottery ticket that doesn\\'t expire recovering now?? ok I averaged in at 19.1 maybe too premature but I bought quite high also it\\'s also not instantaneous right the bond auction icic how to evaluate though what if it\\'s just average bond yield missed the chance to get 2k for free argh if it goes up, I should not be too quick to take profit I should set high targets — like pltr 30, tigr 30 subject to sentiment ewwww nio is at my shorting price ytd now  yea shorting makes it scarier I won\\'t do it again lol my bf earning a lot from gme sia he bought here  whats this oh am I supposed to be watching this? hmm I don\\'t get it why is it an auction but it looks like it went up and then went down over the course of the day new ipo always hot  sounds good urgh I shouldn\\'t stay up today 30 year doesn\\'t matter right I stayed up until 3 even though I knew they wouldn\\'t recover to my buying price usually the most price action is at the start actually lol yea haha good choice I wasn\\'t patient when buying if not I would have bought pltr at 24.50 and tigr at 19.0 or even close pltr should hit at least 30 and tigr should hit 25 before I sell even then im not earning much >_< 4 * 600 + 4.5 * 800 = 6k only if tigr hit 37 like before then it\\'s really a lot I hope I don\\'t have to wait that long... should I get Sea or nio? nio hitting 82 ok then maybe cuz Sea numbers quite big but I guess nio got bigger market also the option calls for pltr 30c next fri is .30 now :O thats free $240   not waived -.- the other 4 that said waived were not waived maybe they credit but never reflect I also never keep track :( yes control buy more now? hmm ol ok no greed I think premarket is safe yea man 30Y treasury bond not impt right I should put 1k in nio I didn\\'t buy nio my last 1k I put 4k in tigr what ok I\\'ll keep for emergency how many gme can I even buy ya now too high lel yea wtf it\\'s not IPO also they did direct listing can meh I thought need to apply oh ya i know this but usually SG not good now wah actually 200 trades is hard yea but it will last 3 months it is a platform right yes hehe i reversed my losses nio doesn\\'t seem as good now hmm tigr is high so fasttt nvm now hold until 37 yay :D hmm im still 56k back to square 1 if both tigr and pltr double from now I will hit 100k 6.8k (autowealth) + 2k (bank) + 46.2k (tiger account) = 55k why leh o.O I don\\'t understand icic the inflation rate increased right shit man tiger is insane +20% alr is it too much for one day but it\\'s only 22.85 yea it can sustain their earnings is gonna be so good but dunno how the market will respond also 25th march icic ok makes sense do you think there will be a friday effect? selling or keeping? ahh I feel like upcoming days will be good so maybe dont sell better me too so I will hold btw BT4222 results out :( how was it passed at least? then ok bah wont fail + project it\\'s at least a B most likely B+ maybe A- I might add nio on the next dip I guess yep makes sense im only putting in 1k lol in 18 days I will have income about 1.9k I\\'ll ask to renew my contract for april so far the prof is quite happy with my work actually quite lame he hired my friend for 20 per hr to do some simple excel stuff and im only getting 15 per hr to do networks in python ehh usd didn\\'t appreciate that much la 30k usd is only 600 more sgd same hehe how many units you bought I actually sold half my position to buy more pltr thought it might correct sold at 23.25 but I still have 400 same I won\\'t sell more alr I bought more pltr so now I got 980 why leh :O isn\\'t 600 tigr almost the same   ok ah I think pltr is less volatile than tigr if things go south then pltr is better to hold oh I had 800 tigr and 600 pltr just shifted over nope avg up a bit my avg was 26 then I bought 380 at 26.5 what other stocks should I look at after I sell pltr at 40 and tigr at 35 ok tell me when you find the stocks that are on my watchlist are all tech growth stocks maybe I\\'ll just sell half pltr and buy ark or amd and aapl sian im not close... I\\'ll just allocate 20% to value how much will this cost? if we consistently sell our positions on thurs aftermarket, and buy again on fri aftermarket, do you think it\\'s possible to earn higher returns? most of the time friday is green maybe if thurs is very green then fri is most likely to be red? but today no bad news just a regular fri not even long weekend not sure also I would think next week will be green everyday lol I mean even for this month cuz the stimulus checks will be distributed over a period of time in late March my thesis is that many of them will put into more well known stocks yes GME hopefully pltr? google cloud! eh fk this is tested and it\\'s not going into my head I like what he is teaching but I don\\'t like how he is teaching it but he is not right how can the yield rise again oh no fk I\\'m not familiar with tensorflow no wonder tigr corrected but it should recover tonight why use softmax for the last layer  this is hard you haven\\'t told me yet idk what is the benchmark oh wells same im not paying attention alr wtf? wtf my bf thinks GME is not risky but tigr and pltr are risky   he earned the most from GME he also bought some SPACs idk what are SPACs but they sound risky to me I scared I might be below avg fk lowest is 12 can\\'t be you but I think it\\'s a B+ no more FCH for me  I need to be above 75th percentile for A- right this is like DBA3803 all over again just that im competing with computing students can\\'t be lol while I did badly for quiz 1, I did a lot better for quiz 2 means I need to do better for the next one which matters a lot more anyway fk it la idc anymore DOS3811 sucks the prof doesn\\'t even track class part it\\'s gonna just be who the TA knows or lottery I fking hate mods like this no worries I think I will enjoy doing the project so I will work hard for it recently I haven\\'t had the motivation to do any exciting work so I think that will change it I need to finish up my prof\\'s work, but he is so laidback I don\\'t feel motivated ok bah we study tgt for next week it\\'s open book right I\\'ll provide you with resources no idea also lol nope im not even supposed to be here but my room has aircon yea of course my close friends  yep yes \"diversifying\" but pltr moves in a smaller degree tempting? like to sell? ahh just buy lol I think so leh it\\'s like the start of a bull-run I was tempted to sell 200 ytd too pltr is kinda underwhelming atm but I think it\\'ll go up eventually wtf really sia they kinda move in the same scale also in terms of per unit thats 20 less  I had 600 pltr and 800 tigr is this the dip you\\'re waiting for next week prob good leh doesn\\'t matter if today holds well or not I think if dip more today will just rebound on mon if it\\'s cheaper more ppl will buy so much propaganda in this subreddit im a sheep HAHA but pltr is not earning enough money!!!! (yet) yay pltr broke 27 i made it even now 700 pltr 720 tigr bonds are so trash now wtf but the environment..... is like last resort it\\'s not worth cuz it\\'ll depreciate I rather keep the cash it\\'s probably quite low totally not worth everyone in Malaysia lives in landed I have relatives in Malaysia i wonder if i get 4.48 then i cannot see my results cant appeal right might be abit troublesome cuz i rmb reading an nus whispers post saying if 1 grade off can bump up ah oh wells sigh worrying too much unnecessarily again cuz dos3811 is a pain true but got the learning journal i only got good alex leong got v good Ying jie got good only alex lau didn\\'t get good i think need v good to get A-  yea man BT if I do as well for the finals like how i did for quiz can get A- A is impossible Lolol i also have a disagreement with my bf regarding gme is this your ideal home?

which ones you got position in why all the weird bio stuff  this is mine good dip to buy tiger ooh it dipped further what is going on im still green lol\\\\ actually missed that big drop I was holding some cash when pltr hit 27 I sold to buy tigr need to hit ace trader this month also so im thinking I need to make a few trades each day im still at 50 this month ._. maybe gold tier also can the SG stocks ah what stocks will be the most negatively correlated with pltr and tigr? what is a beta variance? on avg ah sian today tigr looked ok primed for growth whats this for in python? just use indexing like in excel? d = {}\\n\\nfor item in lst:\\n    d[item[0]] = item[1] does it work I mean you can do anything to prepare data  as in many different ways in python oh ya excel reads as a string you can\\'t assume it\\'s a list it\\'s comma separated so you just do:\\n\\nstring = string[1:-1]\\nlst = list(string.split(\", \")) ok I think colab can\\'t code at the same time yea that works erm you can send me the data 1. write a function\\n2. apply function to all rows using lambda I go do on jupyter you want it in table form ah ah ok easy some will be 0 almost done  I guess need a good understanding of dictionaries not very easy also I guess I don\\'t think many biz ppl can do cuz it\\'s a few steps :D software sometimes quite hard lol python is the easiest method for me even easier than excel  hmmm sold tigr i bought until 1150 ytd sold 250 so far my trades have been on poiny i don\\'t keep cash so i get both the benefits of trading and investment 7k usd now hmm im planning to buy more what are your other positions lol do I get charged more if i edit order after it is partially filled not sure but it is the same order  I\\'ve been taking profit when tigr spike 1k worth then i know that\\'s the time to sell cuz tigr swings a lot yea haha i sell a bit only cuz i know can\\'t time if i have 1150 then i sell 250 i will be happier if it goes up tmr fed meeting maybe today will be red pltr is like very stable i think most of the buying is from institutions yea my bf wouldn\\'t listen part time bah masters oh wtf possible also leh i feel like all these skills ppl generally won\\'t have but would like to learn go and network lol yea Tableau is useful for industry oh no pltr got about 5k now can buy 200 ohhhh  yes so actually not hard im at 120+ yes  i still scalp abit keeping 5k cash now prob the uncertainty for tmr really? nasdaq is tech right tigr is green btw tigr is weird selling stocks increases my avg cost apparently it does not take a weighted average it is first in first out all the ark green leh amd also do you consider amd to be growth or value sea is definitely growth cloudflare Netflix Spotify paypl all green only pltr tesla and airbnb red yea lame sia his name is nick btw let\\'s call him nick from now his family is filthy rich though probably doesn\\'t matter lol 2% only you told me it is big cap but it fell 5% before ahh true maybe i just joined when markets were crazy became numb to it have to be consistent bah i want medium term returns though like 1 month true i guess hope i get venti later LOL you rolled for weapons should i keep 50% cash for tmr i feel like before the meeting will have dip i guess you alr have most characters homeless is still best polearm r3? wow i feel like your diluc stronger than hutao cuz of weapon but hutao stronger in general wtf man  free gems yay im bad at stock picks :( could have bought nintendo, AMD or Sea AAPL or microsoft today, nintendo, Sea and AMD are best performing in my list  haha oh wells how else are you practicing for BT? project? why is pltr and tigr going down do you know one of my friends who plays pokemon named his kid after a pokemon aron his name is ronald so it\\'s kinda a pun  oddish mudkip tsla also anyway i bought more at 20.98 I think we have to accept that these stocks behave this way around 3 am? i couldnt sleep and saw the opportunity sold pltr for it yep im ok with that I sold at 25.75 my avg cost was about 26.24 I bought tigr at 20.7 I think it was a good move today if these recover, tigr will be faster  FUCK I think I rather get qiqi I basically got all except qiqi alr lolol except qiqi I got keqing jean diluc and mona wtf you got it?   wtf poor bennett  nope ohh looks tasty the materials for the fed meeting will be released at 2pm   mostly the NB qns Task4 marks:3Addition is not an one to one map. \\n\\nP(token|Class):0/1+Compute P(token|Class=5)/P(token|Class=1): 0/1.5\\n\\nBrowse text: 0/1.5 + Explain: 0/1.5   (fml.... this one is easy???)\\n\\nTask14 marks:1.9  <— didn\\'t know got 0.1 marks I think the model cannot know if 5 = good, 0 = bad then 5 ended up being the negative class i feel like today will have a big selloff then tmr will gain a lot true  I need venti right\\\\ for the elemental combos  my sucrose is actually c5 but I\\'ll get venti for sure before his banner ends 37 rolls in alr and the event should give plenty  keqing also quite cool ok at least diluc can replace xiangling yay how much can we prepare for BT anyway  it\\'s like nothing gets into my head maybe I should try code from scratch do you wanna do together? zzz premarket trading always have issues again I guess this is all you need to know use L2 when L1 is not enough L2 is better if when you use L1, and the model still overfits why is the market correcting again should have sold ytd huh I mean the same thing happened during the bond auction I thought I managed to buy low at 20.98 ytd :( hmm idk havent studied this part  yea it was good buying opportunity  25 will it go down more later? i sold pltr 25 im doubling down yea lol seeking alpha it dipped not only bcos of what he said la he\\'s like me, but a CEO he\\'s not very high profile like me but in a public interview thats exactly the kind of thing I would say maybe one day I\\'ll join palantir if you shift all your capital to tigr tonight it\\'s an easy 20% gain will he why does it seem like every week got these market events oh is it hmm means it\\'s also good to trade  tbh not impt right cuz I won\\'t know how the market reacts he\\'ll likely say sth neutral but it seems like market alr priced in that he\\'ll say sth bad next time should just sell off every time he is scheduled to say sth easy 3-4k oh no yields are rising again omg wtf yes im now at 8.... shouldn\\'t be the case need to call don again even though he is fking useles out of bag score out of sample siannn what if there\\'s a market crash for random forest ah I think it allows you to get the attribute forest.oob_score_ which gives you the out of sample accuracy as opposed to accuracy trained on the entire dataset  maybe there\\'s no one that can really value software objectively since ppl who know tech are very rare in the finance world right i rmb in corp acc intangible assets need to generate income and the rules regarding it is quite strict wow sudden recovery ya I think I can sleep soundly im fully invested why your link broadcast doesn\\'t work tigr also jumped why CNBC is 2.30 is it retail investors don\\'t have access to all these wtf this isn\\'t fair Fed Keeps Zero-Rate Outlook, Sees Inflation Bump as Short-Lived inflation is expected to be low so far very positive not just neutral next time got news I\\'ll just cash out and buy even though we avoided a crash, still didn\\'t gain haiz just watch the ad lol what do you mean I think before any news it\\'s like expected that ppl will sell lol like some unspoken secret in the finance world ya then it\\'s like a guaranteed drop if everyone thinks like that if you don\\'t sell, you\\'re the only one who loses out then thats good, cuz you sold early just stay up to watch the news if bad, then just keep cash true hor but I see that it gets priced in slowly after that also the long green bar doesn\\'t cover the drops from pre-market and ytd pltr was 26.4 on monday, and 26 ytd yea might be true hahaa it\\'s so unfair it\\'s not only the tools, but also news I think my bf is delusional lol he\\'s wondering why gme is not going up powell hasn\\'t spoken yet I think it\\'s uncorrelated leh you\\'re just seeing the variation why are they foreshadowing so much finance ppl are full of fluff ok sounds 80% +ve he\\'s here he coughed omg again  3rd time inflation is lower than expected which is good sounds good quite neutral factual* wow he avoided a qn yea listening to him is a fresh breath of air compared to the shit I heard just now fking reporter his internet keep dcing he talks about upskilling so that ppl can have better jobs instead of simply providing them jobs really a wise person it\\'s my first time hearing him speak the way he says that he\\'s not in the position to comment on the vaccination regime is so good maybe what alex karp said had an impact after all but you know it\\'s stock price increased from 15 to its current price so I think it\\'s alr priced in? yea true could be due to lack of institutional buying he says low rates is not a problem if other indicators like debt, housing prices, etc are ok nope the customer service didn\\'t work btw what is the SLR 31st March next big event? :p I see wah will you pull out funds ok    how to do this?  this one :P I think need to find p(h=well | sneeze), p(h=cold | sneeze),  p(h=allergy | sneeze),  p(h=rhinitis | sneeze) nvm brb japanese tutorial now ok thx but if it\\'s just sneezing symptoms, I don\\'t have to do the chain rule thing right I think im fked for jap tho yep I need to calculate for each though right im scared also use my code ehhh why are tigr and pltr down again? no leh sometimes tigr is up by a lot ohh fk ya he did how does it impact the treasury bond yields? how can the yields fluctuate so much though  ahh is it economy good = yields tend to be higher uhhh nope I know how to do 2 though it\\'s not hard which lecture is it ah okie hehe weifeng tbh im closer to weifeng than my PM associates  i still dk how to do this leh ahh I get it now naive bayes assumes independence thats why can multiply like that  just need to do the table go Sea!  tigr? i sold rmb fifo i bought a lot more i did now I\\'m just using my pltr proceeds to trade other stocks shit nvm i wait !!!! traded hehe tigr going up but pltr did not nope yea which part sorry I\\'m starting now from lecture 5 he is plotting the predictions from the model linspace just makes the grid can just Google and read up ravel is to change the shape from 2 dimensional to 1 dim you can pass 2 dimensional y data e.g. (100, 1) but it will return an error 1 dimensional will be (100,) this one im not sure plot a heatmap i guess actually I know what he\\'s doing now heatmap is the actual predictions predict_proba is to get the probabbility sth like that?  did he comment the code scatter is actual data heatmap is the prediction so the contours are the decision boundaries like you know in decision tree we draw the line in the hyperspace sth like that yea I guess so of that particular class ehh why is SE bid ask spread so high hehe earned 100 usd from SE today ok I study with you  here is what I\\'ve done so far it\\'s just a summary of the slides but I ensured I understand each of the points I think you need to be familiarised with the documentation also at least understand how the attributes and methods work also I bought nio at 43.16 cuz I thought it was low lmao most of the complex code is plotting btw it just does what it does clf means classifier, which refers to the model in tensorflow, you need to build the model before fitting then calling clf.predict haha same but it\\'s actually quite simple leh oh hmmm it\\'s not impt anyway it\\'s just images from the slides actually I learnt most of these in y1 summer lol except for tensorflow we did these for our DBA3803 project 6 yes, 7 no  anyway I think the prof is trying to mimic this it\\'s not just for ensemble you can do it for svm or decision trees also the cmap contours aren\\'t as nice or obvious as this though  can help me with this again thanks  woah I wasn\\'t paying attention to this you mean the mesh_prob[:,:,0] part? it\\'s levels levelsint or array-like, optional\\nDetermines the number and positions of the contour lines / regions.\\n\\nIf an int n, use MaxNLocator, which tries to automatically choose no more than n+1 \"nice\" contour levels between vmin and vmax.\\n\\nIf array-like, draw contour lines at the specified levels. The values must be in increasing order. in short, it determines the location or position of the lines sometimes in python you just put any number as long as it looks ok especially for plotting fk plotting then the mesh thing is an array but bcos I don\\'t have access to his colab im lazy Z: array-like(N, M)\\nThe height values over which the contour is drawn. xx0 and xx1 are X and Y lol nick is wondering why gme is not going up it\\'s probably the curves he\\'s trying to plot cuz if you only put one array it needs to be 3d I think just copy the code and debug lor  if you plot x and y only it will be one line but as you can see there\\'s somewhat a resemblance of a 3rd dimension ideally the curves can be nicer can be used to make sth like this  do we need to know more on conditional entropy + mutual info? entropy is IG right Entropy = Summation of (- p_{i} * log_{2} (p_{i}))  oh ok got it  what is the point of this ah what does this mean Random forest: the best split is determined by searching in a subset of randomly selected features he\\'s talking about the difference between rf and tree bagging ensemble slide 20 I know he mentioned that it doesn\\'t train on the full data I thought it was subset of examples/samples, not features this one is more useful than his slides  I actually don\\'t understand his english any calculation problems for deep learning? I think need to know how to calculate the output based on weights and the model structure for a simple network I actually rmb doing the gradient descent code in BT4212 how to evaluate though  will cover the code for lectures 5 and 6 tmr  I think this one can see images if the yields don\\'t drop will drop more today   just 2 hrs apart honestly I should just track the yield since thats all that seems to matter btw the code looks ok right for ensemble yea\\\\ like over here it is to see the performance of each stage how many models in the ensemble in random forest is number of trees for boosting the idea is they train using the previous input as features in this example, by the 7th iteration can alr after that is overfit right ya  random forest voting is for prediction gradient boosting is using the predictions as features in the next iteration ya each tree got its prediction he\\'s not taking the best tree if got 10 trees, 6 vote yes 4 vote no then ensemble votes yes there is no \\'best\\' tree ya voting also random forest is similar to bagging only 2 differences — rf is decision trees, bagging can be anything and bagging select at bootstrap sampling rf the best split is determined by searching in a subset of randomly selected features for \"feature selection\" tbh I don\\'t understand that part idk bootstrap sampling is for \"examples\" I guess it does lol so maybe thats the difference random forest: randomly sample features\\nbagging: randomly sample data / examples  is it I thought it is random trees  or maybe it is lol  ahh ok you\\'re right  the learning curve for logistic regression is kinda weird isn\\'t it yea actually it makes sense cuz decision tree need a certain amount of data whereas log reg dunnid zzz he is just plotting shit in his ensemble I think the neural nets is nicer lol  how to read the contours dark red areas that correspond to where all the red dots are are good i think means 8 9 10 are not good? okie loss is just loss idk actually I think loss is not squared wonder if there will be any calc qn I haven\\'t covered c is only for logistic or linear regression btw yea yay I\\'d buy some SG banks when I have 1-2m what do you mean by this though isn\\'t dropout on the neurons, which form the layers L1 and L2 are on the weights, dropout is on neurons icic fk man if I study so hard to get A- for BT then end up getting B+ for DOS I\\'ll be pissed I mean you can get C and still be first class really? :O your DOS sure A one lol fk ian need to work harder for my learning journal but if I mess up BT finals then maybe I\\'ll care less alr lol then just focus on learning jap which is lifetime learning what is Adam I think im quite prepared for exam alr now just chill :P it\\'s open internet right I can pre-write some functions okie what are the possible calc qns ah no neural network ones ah I rmb doing in datacamp before lol  how he get this again ah wut why ah whats the formula why is it inconsistent with the one on the left ehh the entropy formula is it this  can help me plug in the numbers  3 +ve 4 -ve  abit big lor ohh  yay omg dunnid to even bring calc if we pre-write all this yea see the exampels  I used the example hmm should be all right idw to overload the notes later too much confusion haha can one la I hope..... every sem struggle so much..... life is a struggle in itself haha until we have enough money, need to continue to hustle  got individual assignment meh ohh  lolol after this you will be very proficient lol fk I thought I would get full marks then all the neural network qns come dead I never learnt qns 33 -40 i cant do woah thats good I couldn\\'t do at all.... need to do some dot multiplication right for weight matrix? omg I hope I guessed correctly I know this one ya I think I put that either that or 5 * 50 ahh oh wells tried my best I could do qns 1-20 perfectly though at least  ya dun have the code tehn got 1 ans is 0 right for high gpa I actually thought it\\'s 20 qns sia haizzz oh ya some qns can google I don\\'t think he can fault me cuz it\\'s open internet fk man nothing on L1 l2 regularization I don\\'t think he taught qns 33-40 leh.... it\\'s not in the slides gdi  why nio pltr and tigr follow the same trend ohh just nice sia  I guess so oh wells I think I\\'ll just hold and take a break I had one chance to sell ytd :( yea  wahhh why ah  definitely not some macro thing  yea earnings soon though TIGR is expected to release earnings on Mar 26, 2021 before the market opens (BMO). now my portfolio is 1400 tigr abit scary  I feel slightly worried putting all my money in tiger brokers I mean the stock hopefully this week how to get this  yea how ah still ok what for free ahh on top of stock voucher? this is worse luckily I alr earned a lot from referrals the BTC is a scam righgt why would you need to send BTC to receive back  :/ 1.678 for 10y yield I think I want to let go of some alr im starting to get scared lol ya I aim to sell around 23 luckily I only bought 1k at 33 I took the loss then continued to trade earned like 4k from tigr 21.94 buy more with tiger coins oh ya hor they never restock :( I think after this period, they will become more selfish with benefits so take advantage while you can no other broker does this except for moomoo shopee doesn\\'t give as much discounts now now is like cashback nonsense I think im quite loyal even though the customer service sucks so far, I haven\\'t experienced issues only 2 — premarket sometimes doesn\\'t go through + cannot do covered calls but covered calls will be implemented soon margin ah nice can try do options play stocks like gambling DBS, AAPL, BABA, AMD, CRWD, SE, LMND, PLTR, (BTC, ETH, CRO), ETFs: (IVV, QQQ, 3067, ARKK, ARKG) thoughts? actually it\\'s really diversified lo must have a lot of money :/  ya wtf but he\\'s 21 this year???? I think all ok except DBS DBS now also quite pricey 16 can\\'t officially invest you started when 18 right I only started when I was 22 ahh was this worth it lol whats this??? oh chey I thought BT $400 in my bank now :( ya to put in 40k total but my Feb pay is $960 so I will survive wah my DOS group also but yingjie and alex leong carrying hard alex lau busy with girlfriend keeping a close eye on this  wah so zai is out of how much? you are the highest? idc about grades alr :) left projects i only care about jap HAHA eval(2 == 2) yea I guess it is just a formal way cuz without the function it is the same you\\'re applying on delivery_fee df[\\'delivery_fee\\'] = df[\\'order_price\\'].apply() colab not easy right to do with ppl I fked up sold NIO last fri I go for lunch my colab session expire -.- btw I managed to get the line number working  I accidentally pressed sth during BT exam then I dunno how to change back man premarket looked so good for tigr BT results out im a bit sad I didn\\'t do much better but I think it\\'s kinda expected 56  woah you\\'ll do well la I got the same as alex  2nd test should be A- median = B+ leh 4k mod different  means I will need to work hard for DOS and BT I will work harder!  sian how ah is this a B+ for me dude finals is 35% programming test is weighted less not that I did well anyway :( 2 A- trying my best the last time we got mediocre grades for DBA3803, we still got A- right I rmb getting below median for a 15% quiz, and below 75% percentile for a 15% quiz but that was mostly project.... it looked like this lol tigr :( yea my entire list is green except BABA, TIGR and CQQQ hmm maybe it was too overvalued but I believe in the business! if it\\'s down now, maybe after earnings it\\'ll do better I can see it around 24-25 cuz I earn a lot if it goes a bit above 22 LOL my avg price is now 21.94 I\\'ll buy another 200 at 20 ohhhh fking yields again 1.7  oh no it got filled ok avg price 21.66  it\\'s going back up!! ok time to turn off sian my prof said I can only claim $1080 now :( cuz I claimed 3.42k alr and he set a budget of 4.5k he needs to apply to increase but he\\'s applying for extension for me yay so maybe work until grad ehh this is not a lot lol I earned 15k from prof jussi y1 summer, y2s1, y2s2, y3s1, y3s2, y4s1 it\\'s a long period of time leh I hope tigr can earn me wah I saw it at 19.68 maybe I just don\\'t look today for me it\\'s partly fear, partly fomo knowing I could have bought lower it\\'ll just crash right which one did you buy ohhh shit UP Fintech’s management will hold an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM on March 26, 2021, U.S. Eastern Time (8:00 PM on March 26, 2021 Beijing/Hong Kong Time). hmm it\\'s actually fri lol you should talk to jeremy more how much you put in ahh have you sold is it like once failed failed forever tbh I don\\'t trust ark that much now I\\'d still buy but I wouldn\\'t put all my money they hold quite a lot of random companies I don\\'t understand I rather buy a few companies I can understand well .... or one I think for my capital ideally is 4-5 nick\\'s gme is doing badly also even though earnings is tmr what do you think the market reaction will be 50-50 right it\\'s down 4% though yea true I feel like it can be reckoning I think the right play is to buy tigr calls today but I have no money alr :( buy for May hmm doesn\\'t seem to work maybe I should learn to use some kind of stock screener  the capital might pour into t bills and lower yields which part I haven\\'t watched episode 10 yet whats different haha ohhh\\' maybe they changed a little btw watch mushoku tensei  will I get??? 51 soon bah 14 days plus it lasts until next month ok 53 rolls now got razor and rust btw for the dimensions qn for BT finals the format is \\'x * y\\' right not \\'x*y\\' oh shit maybe thats why I got wrong T_T cuz the format indicated was x * y idk maybe I got it wrong I put x * y cuz autograded oh ya google forms nvm I just sent an email to clarify why are TIGR and FUTU down so much ah can\\'t find any news \"In financials the biggest increase in short exposure was in Futu Holdings followed by JPMorgan Chase & co while in communications the biggest increases were in ViacomCBS\" nothing on tigr though maybe unhappy whale investor shorts tigr after poor customer service 2 more days to earnings this time have to keep until earnings lol look at capitaland now  how he make oh it\\'s the US-China sanctions -\\\\_(ツ)_/- why nio, futu and tigr dropping but tigr and futu abit too much lol \"For these questions, we checked them manually.\" for the dimension qns I probably got most of them wrong anyway I just randomly plucked in the numbers ohh just reading up on tigr now haha  some table I found on twittr I don\\'t actually know what these numbers mean so far everything I heard from financial websites, reddit and twitter has been positive tigr growth qfin also down chinese fintech for loans would buy more if I could how to join ohh nah  all the fintech dropping UPST also  choose wrong stocks how can this be though AAPL still kinda low compared to its ATH what are its main components f back to the 18 levels honestly fintech very volatile UPST was mentioned quite a lot together with tiger  tiger will have its day : ) futu had good earnings though tigr is more than that 37 is ATH right now is 18 more than 50% true avg down alr lmao I bought at 20  but not like it can change much I bought a lot at 22-23 I think I have to sell some on thurs to minimise myself to risk and I expect it to recover to 22-23 by then??? then keep half for fri in case earnings is good yea dunno the sentiment sia but now is a good time to buy hehe hmm I should go book my IPPT earn $200 I hope  the rewards now are so much better tigr recovered in post wah 17.8 sia I scared tigr plunged like gme did after ER zzz I couldn\\'t convince nick to sell uhhh... 250? no it was a lot 60 units at 257 i believe in tigr but not gme ya just very volatile lor $1 price diff may mean a lot to me but not the marketr the ER is painful to read why is it not audited lol the quarterly results look ok but the full year sucks 56 rolls if I buy 34 rolls im guaranteed alr but next month got 5 more I got stringless alr   your other groups ah sian that sucks luckily my groups have yingjie and usually if other ppl care, I would care too alex lau? he\\'s slacking off this sem I also wanted to but I realised I don\\'t enjoy doing nothing woah today tigr going up :D should I buy a game for $28 quite cool  you can see that the characters are well designed on the left you have the businessman, center is the political, right is the traditional mafia boss so far they framed you for killing someone and want to turn you to the police but genshin no content LOL sad is everyone year 4? wow y3 was my serious hustle year y1 was kinda chill, then y2 was exploring new stuff + exchange maybe cuz I didn\\'t know what to do in y1 poly kids are more independent and self-motivated HAHA working life can\\'t slack alr but there\\'ll be no end if stock markets do badly :( I honestly want to get 500k by 35 and do a chill job/side business actually im below 50k now sigh tbh I experienced worse in JC camp lol or similar* noodle eating using mouth with opposite gender crawling in oyster sauce, sand and random sheet on a canvas in the field, to pick up scrabble letters using mouth to make words and score points I didn\\'t like it lol it was really smelly  this event  ok bah haha ooh I got 27/30 is it the stupid table thingy where you have to define the variables, etc he\\'s just trying to formalise it lol actually tableau just need intuition nope I think I wouldn\\'t have enjoyed it it was a blessing in disguise RC4 FOC was quite fun very wholesome even though we were peer pressured to stay up late, it wasn\\'t forced was it fun though ahh thats why I did badly for y1 :( I think I wouldn\\'t have been in your group cuz I was acc but if BBA, then probably cuz our names start with L lol my fsp group was ian alex and cheng hong :D you should have joined BACT earlier when tingwei and alex leong were still active ahh you had other CCAs ya this hmm idk I think they had no time to look since they released the results so fast hehe I plan to finish learning google apps script tutorials today learn with me :D javascript lets do together いっしょうにべんきょうしょう！ メールください me-ru is email testing stuff let me know if you receive it\\'s quite fun every 3-4 episodes he goes on a different adventure I love it did you receive? :D your nus email is it maybe check spam hmm weird maybe only gmail lemme try my own nus mail; whats your gmail ya I didn\\'t receive also received? ah fk have? LOL ok nice it works thought it\\'s bugged cuz the code failed to execute saying there\\'s no receipent OHHH weird leh I sent to my email alts then no error and I actually received this will help me improve my workflow when I join shopee cuz I can concat data from many sources into gsheets then mass email and can schedule also! today\\'s project lol turns out that the current solutions are not working so can\\'t just copy this is the working API now  what kind of metrics will be useful?  yea alpha vantage API they\\'re quite fast whats VWAP?  ok I will go try later how to use?  idk how to do in google sheets, but it\\'s possible cuz it\\'s an API that can be called by javascript I just prefer python when I do harder stuff for simpler stuff I can use google apps script which ones are useful?  we can do together :P do you have github? github is impt it\\'s like a ticket to your next big job go make  today looks red nio pltr all affected but nasdaq only down a bit why ah dunno hmm yea damn hard to time the bottom so I shouldn\\'t blame myself  tigr im confused  yea im just scared I have to hold this long  sell all ah 6k usd I\\'ll be below capital I was aggressive at the wrong time $17 alr yea hopefully won\\'t get worse tho  hope it gets better after today no reason why it is going down damn the later questions were so heavily weighted...   im so careless....  actually idk how to do qns 18 to 20 I kinda guessed.. idk how to get \\'unprofessional\\' for qn 18 no not sure if could have saved I think I put 50 * 10 haiz instead of 10 * 50  some ppl are just really smart actually I like the transparency for this mod normally the TAs for biz mods wouldn\\'t even care this guy responds to emails fast create and follow me :D ehh whats the catalyst ah why are futu and tigr so down 8-9% just make first  at least im not bagholding GME   season 2? oh thats fast? just today? btw why aren\\'t we trading even if im down I can still sell now, then buy and sell time is money how so uh I sold 235 at 16.75 ya time is money I could have made swing trades instead of feeling bad for myslef I\\'ll still trying to keep a lot of units I just need to free up capital to trade a little I mean I\\'m alr exposed to the risk when holding most of the risk comes with buying the stock are you buying more nio also? how do you set these aggressive targets :O since it\\'s just 1c per unit I need 2c price changes to profit :D but ideally it\\'s about 20 19 cents * 200 = $38 usd but you mentioned that using such big capital to earn such a small amount is not worth right I think it can still add up no idea not many ppl posting about tigr actually thats what ppl said about 19  weifeng bought at 19 now he\\'s like fml 100 he\\'s the kind who would buy all the 3 local banks he thinks it\\'s possible to drop to 5 yea I mean the 52 week range is 5 to 36 if earnings bad then gg tigr is still quite a niche stock tho it\\'s not well known uh im still keeping la just trading a bit for intraday yea im finding it hard to trade yea thats true im only doing intraday so that I don\\'t miss out if it rises nope I managed to flip it only to buy more tigr at 20 (what I thought was the psychological bottom) nio seems good to trade ahh so you think it\\'s not a good buy now? after I profit from tigr I guess I don\\'t tend to use so much to trade alr maybe just like 20k alrights I have gained like 5 tigr shares for my efforts to trade today I really cannot time bigger market movements so idk whether it\\'ll go to 15 or 17 so I won\\'t bother doing that no I think it\\'s mostly the US-china tensions HAHA he is very direct really? ooh ok premarket looks like recovering  15.99 now :( pltr looks better  I reduced it but took the losses trading mah about 800-1000 cuz it was going down, I guess I earned some value im not confident about today\\'s performance maybe tmr  it\\'ll get better :) 15  damn scary yea I think I\\'ll not put in anymore also just enjoy life abit such a heavy correction though imagine the ppl who bought at 30+ yea I promise to try to look only every 30 min definitely im far too deep alre losing a lot imagine if I managed to buy 14.60 -.-  premarket hit 14 actually hold with conviction  but -5% again sounds sad far cry from 20 yea but I should sell some in the first trading hour whats your avg price now I think the argument against that is the china-US tension still looms in the background so against that threat, tigr\\'s price still has room to grow how many units 600?  back to 16 :) nio, sea, pltr doing better tho nio leh why is tigr only affected  earnings is tmr should have diversified yea fk man  need to get more than 150% revenue growth today the yoy revenue growth from previous year Hey Nelson,\\ni got your number from my friend, hearing that you are good with Python. Was wondering if you are able to help us with it? woah he is from NTU  it\\'s that time of the year apparently it\\'s different oops just finished presentation Total revenues increased 136.5% year-over-year to US$47.2 million.\\nTotal net revenues increased 132.4% year-over-year to US$42.9 million.\\nNet income increased to US$9.4 million from negative US$0.2 million in the same quarter of last year. less growth quite good actually sustained high growth Sea is higher, but their market cap alr so high for sure maybe 25 I\\'ll sell 840 units keep 800 might drop later though :( but I\\'ll still keep until at least first hr yea cuz ppl not awake  :( I hate these auth stuff maybe sending emails should just do natively in google apps script sigh but idw work with javascript this one is python different tools for the same thing im just bored in class now cuz I needed to come to sch for presentation I could be sleeping i would have man if I had more money??? ya I think im just gonna not put in any more cash keep >1k is good although when I had very little cash, I was very thrifty LOL  is a neural network right    I feel like all these will be impt for our project so im paying attention same nuu tiger dropped  how do you know if it\\'s low volume is this tiger app HAHA did you hear that wah intense peer review that is counted towards final grade  wtf nightmare sleeping why ah wtf  I don\\'t get it though why is futu up maybe just keep lor hopefully numbers not rigged why didn\\'t I sell :( yea.... the spike is premarket yea even if ppl shorting it is shaking up ppl to sell maybe Fri effect wafu is just low float prob stock manipulation  meituan doing well cuz they\\'re listed in HK  it\\'s really a straight down :( uh next time got earnings we buy 2 days before, sell one day before and then buy again when it goes down after earnings new strat   wtf but futu earnings last week and actually it was similar to tigr lol just that they never plummet that much alos I was expecting +20% -.- premarket was only +15% ya lor didn\\'t expect it to be so bad idw to see how much im down alr lol I think 8k usd  ya lor market irrational maybe they think is fake urgghhhhh  35% though.... means they need to cover eventually ok my target price for tigr is 22-23 need to regain capital and recoup losses  why leh :( end of april once the political tension dies down I think 30 is possible give me hope I was supposed to hit 50k wah tigr short squeeze lets go someone post dd on wsb  as in someone should post hmm but 12.7% is not that high leh :( true they have to cover right and it\\'ll prob go up from now  uhh maybe like certain kinds of food for different meals? still need to randomise but you can set parameters for the population you also want to randomise the number of items ordered per order right so what you need to do is just random sampling 1. pick a random number from range 1 to n\\n2. for loop to randomly sample from the population of foods, without replacement then just make it the same lor yea will you consider taking masters if you want to retire early well fk  got bug who is this lmao analysing Sea ah tell him you from shopee lah when logic doesn\\'t work just use authority  just Google GSX fraud not tigr though tigr seems clean wtf 3rd person approach me to ask for help how much should I charge? abit too rushed it is due tmr night lol not now but I can see later send now im not doing manual labor I need money though but the amount I get for assignments is too little for the effort I put in I did enough alr haha just need tigr to go up my 50k become 40k  the assignment is dba3803 never blackmail? woah then never actually report? ohh yea but wont get paid also.... wtf which uni oh ya my sister got kicked out of poly dunno why so cui sigh dunno leh she\\'s supposed to graduate this april  I just went home today then hear a lot of stuff from my other sister and parents lol dunno ah I think they too kind on her keep saying she is just not the study type maybe can try sth else then keep reminding me to encourage her and talk to her more often she never even try I heard she skipped all her classes this month idk man what to do so her life is quite shit now cuz she doesn\\'t bother showering or eating she sleeps like 15 hours a day nope but she still takes allowance from my parents next time if she suffers am I obliged to take care of her too pampered alr yea but cannot give allowance these kind dunno maybe she\\'s just sad she got expelled she was sleeping when I got home my family went to sushi tei for an atas dinner but she didn\\'t come she\\'s intentionally starving herself ya they didn\\'t -.- they tried talking to her for now I guess my dad wants to pay a psychiatrist for a house visit so can diagnose her and seek treatment lmao wtf cuz poly is subsidised right.. ya lor she thinks my parents rich can support her support her until she die even though they are not that rich to do that bursary right sian I would have got free money if I went poly also  but I guess being 1 year faster can have advantages and I liked JC somewhat yea tbh idk whats so good about JC anymore so you know I have a few aunts in my family then they suggested me to talk to my sis more try connect to her, etc but it\\'s not easy she\\'s like some young punk my culture is totally different we\\'re very distant even though we used to be close she deteriorated a lot my other sister improved a lot for her, I think it\\'s just a very deep spiral downwards her lifestyle, living conditions, position in life, relationships with friends and family are all bad it\\'s possibly depression right   her bedroom she literally sleeps on the floor no wah what will happen to BIDU wah ATH is 339 leh now 205  wonder if TIGR is the same if you had 10 billion you can easily manipulate a stock like tigr right is it illegal I mean tigr market cap is only 2b you can easily pump and dump ahhh lolol buy oil?
